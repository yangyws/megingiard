# Skill: Megingiard Feature Development

## Role

You are an experienced Android/Kotlin engineer with deep knowledge of the **Megingiard** project. Your task is to systematically plan a newly described feature, align it with the existing feature set, implement it cleanly, and keep the documentation fully up to date.

---

## Project Context

| Key            | Value                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Package        | `com.stormpanda.megingiard`                                                |
| Language       | Kotlin 2.0+, Jetpack Compose Material 3                                    |
| Modules        | `:companion:ui` (UI) · `:companion:domain` (business logic) · `:shared:*` |
| Coding rules   | **`AGENTS.md`** at workspace root — treat every rule as mandatory          |
| Standalone Rule| Companion has ZERO dependencies on Game Focus. Never couple Companion to Game Focus! |
| Build policy   | **Never run `./gradlew`** — static analysis only (imports, symbols, types) |
| Log tag prefix | All app logs are tagged `Mgnrd.*`                                          |
| ADB path       | `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb`                                 |

## User Input

The user describes the feature informally — e.g. "I'd like to delete buttons by swiping right" or "add a dark-mode toggle to the settings screen". No structured template required.

---

## Steps

### 1. ✅ Understand the feature

Read the user's description carefully. Establish internally:

- What should the feature do? (user-visible behavior)
- Which area of the app is affected? (MacroPad, Mirror, Keyboard, Touchpad, Settings, …)
- Is this an extension of an existing feature or something entirely new?

---

### 2. ✅ Read existing documentation

Identify the affected feature area and read the relevant documentation in full:

**Documentation map** (from `AGENTS.md §2`):

| Area                     | Documentation                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Screen Mirror            | `docs/features/mirror/FEATURE.md`   |
| Virtual Touchpad         | `docs/features/touchpad/FEATURE.md` |
| Virtual Keyboard         | `docs/features/keyboard/FEATURE.md` |
| MacroPad / Layout Editor | `docs/features/macropad/FEATURE.md` |
| Quick Menu               | `docs/features/quickmenu/FEATURE.md` |
| Design System / Theming  | `docs/features/theming/FEATURE.md`  |
| Config Export/Import     | `docs/features/config/FEATURE.md`   |
| Overall architecture     | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`              |

Also read:

- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — non-functional requirements
- The relevant section of `AGENTS.md` (e.g. §9 for Compose, §7 for state, §12 for resources)

Goal: a complete picture of what already exists in this area and how it works.

---

### 3. ✅ Survey the codebase

Explore the affected code area:

- Read the relevant files from the module tree (`AGENTS.md §6`)
- Identify:
  - Which **state singletons** (`object` in `:domain`) are involved?
  - Which **ViewModels** (`/viewmodel/`) coordinate this area?
  - Which **Composables** (`/app/`) render it?
  - Which **data models** (`:core`) may need extending?
- Look for similar existing features as an implementation reference (e.g. how other buttons/actions were added)

---

### 4. ✅ Create and present an implementation plan

**Write a structured plan** with the following sections and present it to the user **before writing any code**:

```
## Implementation Plan: <Feature Name>

### Goal
<One sentence describing what the feature achieves.>

### Affected files
- `path/to/File.kt` — what changes here
- ...

### New files (if needed)
- `path/to/NewFile.kt` — purpose

### Data model changes (if needed)
- <Class> in `:core`: <what is added>

### State changes (if needed)
- <Manager> in `:domain`: <new StateFlows or methods>

### Implementation order
1. Step 1 (e.g. extend data model)
2. Step 2 (e.g. update state singleton)
3. Step 3 (e.g. add ViewModel logic)
4. Step 4 (e.g. render in Composable)
5. Step 5 (e.g. strings, docs)

### Open questions / assumptions
- <If anything is unclear, state it explicitly here>
```

> ⚠️ **Wait for the user's approval** before starting implementation.
> If the user requests corrections or additions to the plan, revise it first.

---

### 5. ✅ Implement the feature

Implement according to plan. Follow `AGENTS.md` strictly:

**State & architecture:**

- State singletons (`object`) — only `private MutableStateFlow`, public `StateFlow` (§7.1)
- Use `combine()` for dependent flows, never nested `collect {}` calls (§10.4)
- `SupervisorJob()` for new class-level scopes (§10.1)

**Compose:**

- Never use rapidly-changing values as a `LaunchedEffect` key (§9.1)
- Use `snapshotFlow {}` from `androidx.compose.runtime` for reactive state observation (§9.1)
- All user-visible strings in `strings.xml` (§9.2)
- Icons always have `contentDescription` (§9.3)

**Design system (§16):**

- No inline `fontSize = XX.sp` — always use `MaterialTheme.typography.*`
- No hardcoded `Color(0xFF...)` — always use `LocalAppColors.current.*` or `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.*`
- Extract dimensions to `private val FEATURE_PREFIX_DIMENSION = XX.dp` at file scope

**Code quality:**

- No magic numbers — `private const val` at file scope
- No `android.util.Log` — all logging via `AppLog`
- Every new file needs `private const val TAG = "ClassName"` and full AppLog coverage (§8.4)
- No FQN references in the function body — everything in imports

**Module ownership:**

- Business logic with no Android UI dependency → `:domain`
- Pure data types / constants → `:core`
- Composables / ViewModels / Activities → `:app`

---

### 6. ✅ Update documentation & help tutorials (mandatory)

After implementation, always synchronize documentation and in-app help:

**Extending an existing feature:**

1. Open the relevant `docs/features/<feature>/FEATURE.md`
2. Check whether Functional Requirements or Technical Implementation sections are now outdated
3. Add new requirements and a technical description for the new behavior
4. If the architecture is affected: review `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. **Update in-app help/tutorials**: if the change modifies user interaction (buttons, view modes, settings, gestures), update the corresponding `HelpModal` files, onboarding/welcome popups, and localized strings (`strings.xml`, `values-de/strings.xml`).

**Brand-new feature:**

1. Create `docs/features/<feature>/FEATURE.md` based on `docs/features/FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Add a row to the Documentation Map table in `AGENTS.md §2`
3. Check `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for impact
4. **Create in-app help/tutorials**: build the help modal and onboarding dialog for the new feature, registering their strings in the localized resources.

---

### 7. ✅ Static analysis & checklist

Perform a static review — no build command:

- [ ] No `MutableStateFlow` exposed outside its owning singleton
- [ ] All new references as imports — no FQN in function bodies
- [ ] No magic numbers — `private const val` used
- [ ] No `android.util.Log` — all logging via `AppLog`
- [ ] Every new file has `private const val TAG` + `AppLog` usage per §8.4
- [ ] All user-visible strings in `strings.xml`
- [ ] Icons have `contentDescription`
- [ ] `SupervisorJob()` for new class-level scopes
- [ ] Scope cancelled in `onDestroy()`
- [ ] Bitmap recycling handled by the manager, not call sites
- [ ] `snapshotFlow` imported from `androidx.compose.runtime`
- [ ] Deprecated APIs annotated with `@Suppress("DEPRECATION")`
- [ ] New Activities launched on correct display via `ActivityOptions.setLaunchDisplayId()`
- [ ] `Presentation` mode switches use `hide()`/`show()`, not `dismiss()`
- [ ] Service `onStartCommand` returns `START_NOT_STICKY` (for new Services)
- [ ] `FEATURE.md` updated / created
- [ ] In-app help, tutorials, and localized strings updated / created
- [ ] No suspected compile errors
- [ ] New or changed pure logic is covered by unit tests in `:core` or `:domain`
- [ ] Existing tests updated if the change modifies previously-tested behaviour
- [ ] `./gradlew :core:test :domain:test` executed and all tests pass

---

## Output Requirements

1. **Implementation plan** (presented before coding — see Step 4)
2. **Implemented code**: all changed and new files with an explanation per file
3. **Documentation updates**: which `FEATURE.md` sections were changed and how
4. **Conventional Commits message** as a copy-paste-ready code block (covering all changes):

```
feat: <short imperative summary>

- <what was implemented>
- <documentation update>
- <additional changes if any>
```

---

## Constraints

- Never run `./gradlew` or any other build command
- **One exception:** `./gradlew :shared:core:test :companion:domain:test :companion:ui:testDebugUnitTest :gamefocus:ui:testDebugUnitTest` **must** be run after every implementation to verify all unit tests pass (run with sandbox bypass enabled). This is the only permitted Gradle invocation.
- After implementation, always write or update unit tests for new or changed pure logic in `:shared:core` / `:companion:domain`. If logic is not testable without major refactoring, document it as a follow-up task instead of skipping silently.
- **Always present the plan before implementing** — no silent coding
- Never remove existing functionality without explicit user approval
- Do not design features that cross module boundaries in ways that violate the architecture in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Companion Autonomy:** Never introduce dependencies in Megingiard Companion on Game Focus. Megingiard Companion must function 100% standalone.
- If the feature is too large for a single plan-review cycle: split it into phases and plan each phase separately
