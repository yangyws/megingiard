## Functional Requirements

### Overview

The MacroPad feature turns the secondary display into a fully configurable button pad. The user can create named profiles, freely place buttons on a canvas, and assign each button one of several action types: keyboard keystroke, gamepad button, mouse button, scroll wheel, or trackpoint (relative mouse movement). Each profile independently controls which virtual input devices (keyboard, gamepad, mouse) are active. Multiple profiles can be created and switched without leaving the use-mode screen. All configuration persists across sessions.

### FR-P1: Configurable Layout Profiles

- The MacroPad MUST support **multiple named profiles** that can be created, renamed, and deleted at any time in the editor.
- Exactly **one profile is active** at a time; the active profile is displayed in use mode. Changing the active profile takes effect immediately.
  Each profile stores its own layout list, macro list, and device flags (see FR-P4, FR-P7, FR-P8).
- Profiles MUST persist across app restarts via **DataStore** (serialised as JSON using `kotlinx.serialization`).
- On a clean install or whenever no profiles exist in the DataStore yet, a single default profile named `"Default"` with a default layout named `"Default"` MUST be created automatically on bootup and persisted.

### FR-P2: Free-Placement Buttons

- Each profile can contain an **arbitrary number of buttons** placed anywhere on the pad canvas.
- Button positions are stored as **normalised coordinates** [0.0, 1.0] relative to the pad dimensions, so the layout scales correctly at any pad size.
- Each button has a user-defined **label**, a **shape** (circle, square, or icon only), a **size weight** (1.0 = default unit size), and an **action** (see FR-P3).
- Buttons MUST be repositioned by **drag** inside the editor canvas when in Free Mode.
- Each layout supports two layout modes via `PadLayoutMode`:
  - **`PadLayoutMode.FREE` (Free Mode)** — Buttons carry normalized `posX` / `posY` coordinates `[0.0, 1.0]` and can be placed anywhere on the canvas with optional snap overlays.
  - **`PadLayoutMode.GRID` (Table Mode)** — Buttons carry discrete `gridCol` / `gridRow` indices inside a configurable `gridCols x gridRows` table grid (default 5×4, min 1×1, max 8×6). `GridLayoutMath` computes cell centers and bounds. Empty cells display a `+` trigger to add buttons directly to that cell; occupied cells render button faces and support long-press editing.
- The editor provides a **grid snap overlay** that can be toggled on and off at any time during layout editing. Two grid modes are available:
  - **Rectangular** — vertical and horizontal lines spaced at 30 dp (half the 60 dp button unit), forming a uniform grid. Crossing points are the snap targets.
  - **Radial** — concentric circles (centred on the canvas) spaced at 30 dp, with **evenly distributed snap points** along each circle. The number of snap points per circle scales with its circumference (roughly one point per 60 dp of arc length) and is always a **multiple of 4** (minimum 4). Circles alternate phase: odd-indexed circles (1st, 3rd, …) have 4 anchor points at the **diagonals** (45°, 135°, 225°, 315°); even-indexed circles have anchors at the **cardinal** directions (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Additional equidistant points fill the gaps between the 4 anchors. A dedicated snap point sits at the exact centre of the canvas. No horizontal or vertical lines are shown.
- The grid mode cycles **Off → Rectangular → Radial → Off** via a single "Change Grid" toggle button located in the second row of the editor toolbar, above the canvas preview.
- When a grid is active, dragged buttons **magnetically snap** to the nearest grid intersection point. When the grid is off, buttons position freely.
- Grid mode is **local editor state** — it is not persisted and resets to Off each time the editor opens.
- While editing the unlocked button layout, the button that was touched or dragged last MUST display four drag handles (using the `"drag_pan"` Material Symbol) placed outside its Top, Bottom, Left, and Right edges with a 4 dp padding. The handles are interactive; dragging from any of the handles moves the button in sync, and they are sized at 16 dp to ensure they do not overlap or obfuscate the button layout.

### FR-P3: Action Types

Each button supports one of the following actions:

| Action type      | Injection target          | Native binary           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `KeyboardKey`    | Linux keycode via uinput  | `keyinjector_arm64`     |
| `GamepadButton`  | Linux BTN\_\* via uinput  | `gamepadinjector_arm64` |
| `MouseButton`    | BTN_LEFT/RIGHT/MIDDLE/4/5 | `mouseinjector_arm64`   |
| `ScrollWheel`    | REL_WHEEL via uinput      | `mouseinjector_arm64`   |
| `TrackpointMove` | REL_X / REL_Y via uinput  | `mouseinjector_arm64`   |
| `BackgroundPeek` | App-level peek toggle     | _(none)_                |

- `KeyboardKey` actions use `KeyInjector` / `ShellKeyInjector` from the keyboard package. Each `KeyboardKey` action MAY carry up to **2 optional modifier keycodes** (`modifiers: List<Int>`, default empty). On button-down, modifiers are pressed in order before the base key; on button-up, the base key is released first, then modifiers in reverse order. Available modifiers: Ctrl L/R, Shift L/R, Alt, AltGr, Meta/Win, Fn (Linux keycode 464). The `keyinjector_arm64` binary accepts keycodes in the range **1–464** (extended from the original 1–254 to include Fn).
- `GamepadButton` actions use `GamepadInjector` / `ShellGamepadInjector`. Each `GamepadButton` action MAY carry up to **3 optional extra button codes** (`extraBtnCodes: List<Int>`, default empty). On button-down, the primary button is pressed first, then extras in order; on button-up, extras are released in reverse order, then the primary button.
- For both `KeyboardKey` and `GamepadButton`, the action picker shows the selectors **inline in a single row** (3 dropdowns for keyboard: base key + 2 optional modifiers; 4 dropdowns for gamepad: primary button + 3 optional extras). Optional slots default to "—" (None).
- `GamepadButton` and all mouse actions use dedicated injectors (`GamepadInjector`, `MouseInjector`) backed by their own native binary processes.

> **Optional: physical-pad merge** — When [Privileged Mode](../privileged-mode/FEATURE.md) is RUNNING and its `Gamepad merge` per-feature flag is enabled, `GamepadInjector` routes all gamepad events to `PrivdGamepadInjector` instead of the virtual uinput path. The privileged daemon writes them into the connected physical controller's evdev node, so games see only one device. Falls back transparently to the virtual gamepad when Privileged Mode is OFF.

- Only the injectors for devices **enabled in the active profile** (see FR-P4) are started; the others stay stopped. The action picker in the editor always shows all action type categories regardless of which devices are currently enabled — the flags are derived from the buttons, not the other way around.

### FR-P4: Per-Profile Device Flags

- Each profile has four independent boolean flags: `enableKeyboard`, `enableGamepad`, `enableMouse`, `enableTouch` (all default **`false`** — new profiles start with all injectors off).
- These flags are **not user-configurable** directly. They are automatically recomputed whenever the button list changes (add / edit / delete) by inspecting the action types of all buttons. The exact derivation rules are:
  - If the profile contains any button with a `Macro` action, all four flags are force-enabled (`true`).
  - Otherwise, each flag is set to `true` if any button matches the following actions:
    - `enableKeyboard = true` if any button has a `KeyboardKey` action.
    - `enableGamepad = true` if any button has a `GamepadButton` action.
    - `enableMouse = true` if any button has a `MouseButton`, `ScrollWheel`, or `TrackpointMove` (with `PHYSICAL_MOUSE` tracking mode) action. (Note: `MirrorTouchProjection` is explicitly excluded from this derivation because the screen mirror presentation manages its own touch injector lifecycle).
    - `enableTouch = true` if any button has a `TrackpointMove` (with `VIRTUAL_TOUCH` tracking mode) action.
- Injector start and stop lifecycle is centrally managed by `InjectorLifecycleManager`, which evaluates `AppStateManager.uiMode`, `MacroPadState.activeLayout`, and `AppStateManager.promptInFlight`. When editor screens or settings popups are open, all injectors are stopped; when returned to MacroPad use mode, only enabled injectors for the active layout are started.

### FR-P5: Trackpoint Button

- A trackpoint is a **regular `PadButton`** with a `TrackpointMove` action, not a separate profile-level toggle.
- Trackpoint buttons are **always circular**, have no visible label, and are sized by a `TrackpointSize` enum: `SMALL` (1.5×), `MEDIUM` (2.0×), `LARGE` (3.0×), where the multiplier scales `MP_BUTTON_UNIT_DP` (60 dp).
- In use mode, dragging a finger on a trackpoint button translates relative motion depending on the configured **Tracking Mode**:
  - **Virtual Physical Mouse**: relative motion is translated into **REL_X / REL_Y mouse events** via `MouseInjector.moveMouse()`. Sensitivity is fixed at 3× the raw pixel delta (`MP_TRACKPOINT_SENSITIVITY = 3f`).
  - **Virtual Touch**: relative motion is translated into absolute touches on the primary landscape display (`1920x1080`) via `TouchInjector.injectTouch()`. A virtual cursor position is tracked internally (initially at center `(0.5f, 0.5f)`) and persists across finger lifts, allowing subsequent swipes from the same position. The internally tracked position (`virtualCursorX` / `virtualCursorY`) is clamped to screen boundaries `[0.0f, 1.0f]` at all times. Touch events injected to the system are clamped to the safe overrun range of `[-0.5f, 1.5f]` to prevent coordinate wrapping or jumps while allowing the system cursor to catch up. Relative movements are tracked unclamped during dragging, but snap immediately to the internally tracked position as soon as the user changes drag direction (sign change in delta) to eliminate lag or dead zones when moving back from edges. There is no snap-back logic on release, and relative movements during dragging are only constrained by the touch injector's safety overrun clamp of `[-0.5f, 1.5f]`.
- **ScrollWheel buttons** render two up-chevron icons (full opacity) and two down-chevron icons (half opacity), vertically centred. Scroll sensitivity is 12 px per wheel unit (`MP_SCROLL_SENSITIVITY_PX = 12f`).
- **BackgroundPeek buttons** render a visibility icon: `Icons.Rounded.Visibility` when peek is inactive, `Icons.Rounded.VisibilityOff` when active.
- In the editor, the `ButtonEditDialog` hides the label field and shape dropdown when action is `TrackpointMove`, `ScrollWheel`, or `BackgroundPeek`. When the action is `TrackpointMove`, a dropdown selector is displayed to choose between the **Virtual Physical Mouse** and **Virtual Touch** tracking modes, with a dynamic explainer text displayed below the dropdown.

### FR-P6: Multi-Touch Button Support

- The MacroPad MUST support **simultaneous presses** of multiple buttons via multi-touch.
- Each finger is independently tracked by `PointerId`; down and up events are matched per pointer so no button is accidentally stuck in the pressed state.
- The gesture detector scope incorporates a `try-finally` block that invokes `engine.releaseAll()` to ensure both visual highlighted states and virtual input injections are cleanly released if a gesture is cancelled by system interruptions (such as status bar pull-down, system back gestures, or the Quick Menu overlay taking focus).
- Attempting to press a button whose required injector type is disabled MUST show a temporary inline feedback message in the MacroPad surface.

### FR-P6: No Special Permissions Required

- The MacroPad MUST function without root access or additional Android permissions beyond the app's declared set.
- On the AYN Thor, `/dev/uinput` is accessible under the standard shell UID (2000), and `/dev/input/event6` (touch injection) is `crw-rw-rw-`.

### FR-P7: Macros

- A **macro** is a named, **per-profile** sequence of timed input steps stored in `PadProfile.macros`. Each profile maintains its own macro list; macros are not shared across profiles.
- Macros are managed via the **Macro Library** editor (opened via a dedicated "PlaylistPlay" action button row below the profile chips in the profiles management section).
- Each macro contains a list of **`MacroStep`** subtypes: `GamepadButtonTap`, `JoystickMove`, `JoystickPath`, `DPadTap`, `TouchTap`, and `TouchPath`. Each step has `startTimeMs` and `durationMs` fields that allow overlapping parallel steps within the same macro. `JoystickPath` is created exclusively by the physical gamepad recorder and carries a list of timestamped `PathSample` entries that replay the full continuous stick trajectory. `TouchPath` is created by the continuous gesture recorder and carries a list of timestamped `TouchSample` entries that replay a full continuous multi-touch trajectory.
- A **`PadAction.Macro(macroId)`** button action MUST reference a macro by ID. Pressing the button is **tap-to-toggle**: the first tap starts the macro; a second tap stops it by cancelling its coroutine. While the macro is running (driven by `MacroExecutor.runningMacroIds` StateFlow), the button triggers a **unified animation**: the icon/text content breathes (`1.0x` to `1.12x`) on all button shapes, the background pulses with an infinite alpha animation for `SQUARE`/`CIRCLE` buttons, and expanding circular ripple rings (Sonar Ripple) pulse outward past the button borders and fade to zero **exclusively** for the `ICON_ONLY` shape.
- Macros support a **Loop** mode (`Macro.loopEnabled = true`): the step sequence repeats until the user stops it with a second tap. An optional `Macro.loopPauseMs` (0–2000 ms, in 100 ms steps, auto-extending scale) controls the delay between loop iterations.
- Macros support timing randomization (`Macro.randomizeTimingEnabled = true`). When enabled, random duration offsets in `[0, randomizeTimingRangeMs]` (inclusive) are dynamically generated and added to the duration of non-stick/non-touch-path steps on every execution run (including each loop iteration). Preceding step extensions accumulate and sequentially delay the start times of all subsequent steps to preserve the chronological timeline. Stick inputs (`JoystickMove`, `JoystickPath`) and touch paths (`TouchPath`) are excluded from duration randomization but still delayed in their start times. The maximum random range is configured via a slider that ranges from 10 to 100 ms (default 20 ms). The numbers must be freshly generated on each loop iteration and execution run.
- Macros are managed at the profile level. The profiles section displays a dedicated **"Macros…"** (PlaylistPlay) action button row directly below the profile chips.
- The macro editor supports two switchable editing modes:
  - **List/Edit View**: step list only (no timeline strip above the list), optimized for full per-step editing, testing, recording, and macro loop configuration.
  - **Timeline View**: a **full-height vertical timeline** (Canvas) where time runs top-to-bottom and steps are rendered in lanes by overlap, optimized to maximize screen real estate by hiding secondary controls.
    - The timeline always uses the full available screen width.
    - Lane widths are divided adaptively based on the current number of required overlap lanes.
    - A small horizontal inset is applied so the timeline content is not flush against the screen edges.
    - Each step block contains a short action label (for example gamepad short code, joystick stick+direction, D-Pad direction, or Tap).
- The List/Edit mode exposes the action row: **"Step"**, **"Record"** (gamepad), **"Record"** (touch), and **"Test Run"** (when steps are present), along with the **Loop toggle** and a **Pause between repetitions** slider. These editing and settings controls, along with the undo/redo/shift control header, are hidden in **Timeline** mode to give the timeline maximum screen real estate.
- Gamepad recording has two strategies depending on Privileged Mode availability:
  - **Virtual overlay (always available):** Uses the on-screen gamepad overlay (`GamepadRecordingOverlay`) and records `GamepadButtonTap`, `JoystickMove`, and `DPadTap` steps via `GamepadRecordingManager`.
  - **Physical pass-through (requires Privileged Mode with gamepad recording enabled and daemon running):** Reads the physical controller's raw evdev stream via `PhysicalGamepadRecordingManager`. The daemon subscribes to the physical device node (`SUB GAMEPAD`) without an exclusive grab, so the target game continues to receive the same input simultaneously. Button presses become `GamepadButtonTap` steps, D-Pad hat changes become `DPadTap` steps, and analog stick movement becomes `JoystickPath` steps containing all accumulated `PathSample` entries. A gesture begins when the stick exceeds the per-stick dead-zone threshold (read from `MacroPadSettings.deadzoneLeft` / `deadzoneRight`) and ends when it returns inside the dead zone; any open gesture at stop time is force-closed with the last known position. All samples within a gesture are stored verbatim — no decimation is applied. **End-of-step invariant:** `JoystickPath.durationMs` is always strictly greater than the largest `PathSample.offsetMs` (the recorder uses `lastOffsetMs + 1`), and the compiler additionally skips any sample whose offset would land at or after `durationMs`. This guarantees the end-of-step neutral reset event is the last event at the step's end timestamp and the stick returns to neutral.
- **`MacroStepEditDialog` editing of recorded steps:** `JoystickPath` and `TouchPath` are treated as recorded, non-editable step types. The dialog renders a read-only summary (e.g. stick and sample count for joysticks, or sample points count for gestures) and exposes only the timing controls (start / duration). The path sample list is preserved verbatim by the dialog's `copy()` builder; switching to a different step type is intentionally disabled.
- The editor includes **Undo** and **Redo** as icon buttons for step mutations (add/edit/delete/recorded-touch insertion), visible only when in **List/Edit** mode.
- Mode switching is exposed as two always-visible chips (**List/Edit / Liste/Bearbeiten** and **Timeline / Zeitleiste**) with a leading **View/Ansicht** label, using the same visual style as the Quick Menu Bar Profile/Layout selector chips.
- The control header (Undo/Redo and global **Shift mode** 3-chip selector) uses compact vertical spacing to preserve vertical space and is hidden in **Timeline** mode to maximize screen real estate.
- The editor includes a global **Shift mode** selector (default: **End Δ**) whose value pre-fills the per-step selector in `MacroStepEditDialog`.
- `MacroStepEditDialog` contains its own **Shift mode** 3-chip selector. The mode selected here is what is actually applied when saving the step.
- In `MacroStepEditDialog`, step-type chips use the same visual style as Quick Menu Bar selector chips and include leading icons (controller icon for Gamepad, stick icon for Joystick, and D-pad-like grid icon for D-Pad).
- Shift behavior (implemented in `applyShiftSubsequent()` in `:core`, governed by `ShiftMode`):
  - **`ShiftMode.NONE`** — only the edited step is replaced; no other step moves.
  - **`ShiftMode.START_DELTA`** — steps whose `startTimeMs ≥ oldStep.endTimeMs` are shifted by `newStart − oldStart`. A pure duration change produces a zero start-delta, so nothing else moves.
  - **`ShiftMode.END_DELTA`** — steps whose `startTimeMs ≥ oldStep.endTimeMs` are shifted by `newEnd − oldEnd`. Handles duration changes, start moves, or both; the delta reflects the full change in the edited step's end time.
  - **Key invariant for both non-NONE modes:** the eligibility threshold is always `≥ oldStep.endTimeMs`. Steps that start before the edited step's old end — including concurrent or overlapping steps — are never shifted regardless of mode.
  - **Adding a new step** when mode ≠ NONE shifts existing steps at/after the new step's start time by the new step's duration.
  - Shifted start times are clamped to `[0, 10 000 ms]`.
- Steps are configured in **`MacroStepEditDialog`** which provides: step-type chips (Gamepad / Joystick / D-Pad; Touch Tap shown read-only when editing), gamepad button dropdown, 3×3 direction grid for joystick/D-Pad, a magnitude slider (0–1, default 1) for joystick, and timing controls for start/duration.
- New-step timing defaults and controls:
  - New steps open with `startTimeMs = (latest macro end) + 2000 ms`.
  - Duration uses a base slider range of `0..1000 ms`.
  - Both timing rows expose quick delta buttons: `-100`, `-10`, `-1`, `+1`, `+10`, `+100`, `+1000`.
  - Both timing sliders use a constant `100 ms` step resolution.
  - For both start and duration, pressing a positive delta that exceeds the current slider max extends the slider scale in `+1000 ms` steps.
- **Touch Recording Flow:** When the user taps **"Record Touch"** in the timeline editor, they are prompted with a dialog to choose between **"Tap"** and **"Gesture"** recording (the choice is always required, so the dialog always appears). Confirming starts the screen mirror on the secondary display via `RecordingMirrorPresentation`. To avoid display/VirtualDisplay conflicts on the AYN Thor dual-screen device, the service temporarily releases/pauses the active main mirror capture session and hides the main `MirrorPresentation` window, then shows `RecordingMirrorPresentation` on the secondary display.
  - **Tap Mode:** The user taps a single position. The presentation intercepts the tap, records the normalised coordinate, and signals `TouchRecordingManager.onTapRecorded()`. The timeline editor observes the `recordedTap` StateFlow and appends a `MacroStep.TouchTap` step. Immediately after recording, a brief DOWN→UP touch event (`RMP_FEEDBACK_TAP_DURATION_MS = 50 ms`) is also injected on the primary display to give the user real-time visual confirmation that the tap was captured.
  - **Gesture Mode:** The user performs one or more continuous, possibly multi-finger gestures. Recording begins automatically as soon as the first finger touches the screen, and each gesture segment ends when no fingers remain on the screen (the pointer set becomes empty or the current pointer event reports all fingers released). All touch events during recording are also injected live to the primary display via `TouchInjector` so the user can see their gestures in real time. The overlay remains open after each segment and exposes **Cancel** plus **Stop & Save** controls in the lower letterbox row of the recording presentation. **Cancel** discards all accumulated segments; **Stop & Save** trims any idle time before the first touch so the first gesture starts at `t = 0 ms`, then appends the accumulated segments as separate `MacroStep.TouchPath` steps in one undoable editor operation, preserving pauses between gestures. The overlay records relative time offsets, coordinate streams, and slot-aware pointer IDs (0..9) into `TouchSample` entries. Touches that land inside the mirrored content area are mapped through the letterbox geometry to normalised coordinates `[0..1]`; if an already-tracked pointer moves outside the content area, its coordinates are clamped to `[0..1]` rather than dropped — preventing spurious UP/DOWN pairs for fingers that briefly exit the mirror boundary. Before each segment is stored, `TouchRecordingManager` finalises the sample list so every pointer whose last recorded event is not `TouchAction.UP` receives a synthetic `UP` sample at the last known coordinate. This guarantees recorded touch paths cannot leave a virtual touch slot pressed during replay even if Compose drops a terminal pointer transition.
  - In both modes, the main mirror presentation is restored automatically upon completion or cancellation.
- **Gamepad recording flow — virtual overlay:** The user taps **"Record Gamepad"** in the timeline editor → a confirmation dialog appears (skipped on subsequent uses via `MacroPadSettings.skipGamepadRecordDialog` — activated by the "Don't show again" button; also skipped automatically when physical recording is available) → the user confirms → `MacroTimelineEditor` starts `GamepadInjector` (tracking whether recording was the one that started it), then waits `MT_GAMEPAD_INJECTOR_INIT_MS` (200 ms) for InputFlinger to register the virtual device before showing the overlay → `GamepadRecordingManager.startRecording()` is called and `GamepadRecordingOverlay` renders inline above the editor → touches on face buttons, D-Pad, shoulder buttons (LB/LT on left, RT/RB on right), Start/Select, and both stick circles (with L3/R3) are recorded as `MacroStep.GamepadButtonTap`, `MacroStep.DPadTap`, and `MacroStep.JoystickMove` events and simultaneously forwarded live to the primary display through `GamepadInjector` → tapping **Stop** finalises the recording, trims the idle offset before the first input to 0 ms, and appends the recorded step block to the current macro timeline. `GamepadInjector.stop()` is only called if recording was the one that started it — an injector already running for another purpose (e.g., macro playback) is left running. The **Home** button (`BTN_MODE`) is not exposed in the recording overlay. **Joystick fidelity:** Axis values are quantised to 8 cardinal/diagonal directions at full deflection (`±1.0`) via `GamepadRecordingManager.setJoystick`, which returns the snapped values. `MacroTimelineEditor` uses these snapped values for both the recorded `JoystickMove` step and the live `GamepadInjector` call — ensuring the target app sees exactly the same 8-directional input during recording as during macro playback. No dead zone is applied to the stick touch surface; the only neutral condition is an exact `(0, 0)` from finger lift.
- **Gamepad recording flow — physical pass-through:** When Privileged Mode is RUNNING, tapping **"Record Gamepad"** bypasses the confirmation dialog and directly starts a physical recording session → `PhysicalGamepadRecordingManager.startRecording()` is called, which sets `PrivdGamepadInjector.isRecordingActive = true` (suppressing injected output so the virtual device does not double-fire) and sends `SUB GAMEPAD\n` to the daemon → the daemon begins forwarding raw evdev events from the physical controller node via `PrivdClient.evdevEvents` → a `PhysicalGamepadRecordingSheet` fullscreen overlay renders live controller state (currently pressed buttons shown with their full localised labels including face-button swap, D-Pad direction, and stick position) with Stop and Cancel actions — there are no virtual buttons to tap; the user presses buttons on the physical controller → tapping **Stop** calls `PhysicalGamepadRecordingManager.finishRecording()`, which closes open gestures, sends `UNSUB GAMEPAD\n`, restores injection (`isRecordingActive = false`), and emits `GamepadRecordingState.Done` → `MacroTimelineEditor` observes the `Done` state via `LaunchedEffect`, trims the leading idle period, appends the recorded steps, resets the manager state, and dismisses the sheet.
- **Gamepad recording overlay layout:** Four-zone layout — (1) **Title bar**: full-width Row with title + Abbrechen/Fertig buttons; (2) **Controls strip**: three independent `Row` groups placed via absolute `Modifier.offset()` — left `[LB (outer) | LT (inner)]` at `GRO_LB_X`/`GRO_SHOULDER_Y`, center `[SE | ST]` at `GRO_CENTER_X`/`GRO_SHOULDER_Y`, right `[RT (inner) | RB (outer)]` at `GRO_RB_X`/`GRO_SHOULDER_Y`; (3) **Main area** rendered as `BoxWithConstraints` with absolute proportional positioning: L-Stick center at `GRO_LEFT_STICK_X` (15 %) / `GRO_STICK_Y` (43 %), R-Stick center at `GRO_RIGHT_STICK_X` (85 %) / `GRO_STICK_Y` (43 %), D-Pad top-left at `GRO_DPAD_X` (10 %) / `GRO_DPAD_Y` (62 %), Face Cluster top-left at (`GRO_FACE_X` (90 %) − `GRO_FACE_CLUSTER_SIZE`) / `GRO_FACE_Y` (60 %) (all as fraction of `BoxWithConstraints` width/height); positions are clamped with `coerceAtMost`/`coerceAtLeast` to prevent off-screen clipping; `GRO_FACE_CLUSTER_SIZE = 148 dp` with `GRO_FACE_CLUSTER_PADDING = 4 dp` around each face button; (4) **Bottom buttons**: L3 at `GRO_L3_X` (4 %) and R3 at (`GRO_R3_X` (96 %) − button size), both pinned to the bottom edge via `maxHeight − GRO_FACE_BUTTON_SIZE − GRO_PADDING`. The `PressableSurface` and `StickSurface` composables use `pointerInput(Unit)` with `rememberUpdatedState` for their callbacks and `try/finally` blocks to guarantee neutral reset on gesture cancellation.
- The macro list is a **flat list** (no folders). Macros can be reordered via drag handle, and CRUD operations (add, edit, duplicate, delete) are available via context menu on each row.
- Macro CRUD is performed through `MacroPadState.addMacro()`, `updateMacro()`, `deleteMacro()`, `renameMacro()`, `reorderMacros()`. All mutations persist via `MacroPadSettings.saveMacroPadData()`.
- **Direct Editor Navigation & Callback-based Backstack:** When creating or editing a macro directly from `ButtonEditDialog` via the "New" or "Edit" button of the Macro category action, the layout editor navigates the user **directly** to `MacroTimelineEditor`, completely bypassing the flat macro list view. The `ButtonEditDialog` state is kept active in the background to preserve all unsaved form fields. Explicit callbacks (`onDirectEditSave` / `onDirectEditCancel`) dictate the exit behaviors. If the user cancels out of a newly created macro without adding any steps, the empty draft is automatically deleted from the profile's macro list.


### FR-P8: Multi-Layout Profiles

- Each profile MUST support **multiple named layouts** (`PadLayout`). Each layout has its own button list and background display settings.
- Exactly **one layout is active** at a time within the active profile. Layout switching is performed via the current layout navigation controls in the MacroPad UI.
- Layouts can be **created, renamed, and deleted** in the editor. The editor toolbar shows a horizontally scrollable layout bar with shared selectable chips for each layout. Long-press drag reorders layouts within the profile.
- Each layout chip, when more than one layout exists, has a delete action.
- A new layout can be created as a **blank** layout. When creating a new layout, the full-screen **Layout Settings Editor** (`LayoutSettingsEditor`) is displayed immediately to configure the name and default button colors. Background configurations are managed separately via the Background toolbar button.
- Users can duplicate existing layouts to reuse their configuration, buttons, and cutouts (deep copy with new UUIDs).
- Device flags (`enableKeyboard`, `enableGamepad`, `enableMouse`) are derived from the **union of all buttons across all layouts** in the profile (via `withSyncedDeviceFlags()`).
- Layouts are persisted as part of `PadProfile` (serialised via `kotlinx.serialization`). If a stored `PadProfile` does not contain a `layouts` list, a default layout named "Layout 1" is created on load, populated with the profile's top-level `buttons` list.

### FR-P9: Background Display

- An optional **Background Display** mode renders the Screen Mirror output behind the MacroPad buttons on the secondary display.
- Enabled via a **toggle** in MacroPad tool settings (default: off).
- When Background Display is enabled and the user enters MacroPad mode, `ScreenCaptureService` is **automatically started** (identical to how Mirror mode auto-starts when that setting is active). The user is prompted for MediaProjection consent if not already capturing. Declining within a session is respected until the next mode entry.
- When background display is enabled and capturing is active, the `MirrorPresentation` renders `BackgroundMacroPadOverlay` instead of `MirrorScreen`. On the primary screen, `MainAppScreen` shows an empty black placeholder instead of `MacroPadScreen` (the pad is rendered on the Presentation).
- In background display mode, the **Quick Menu Bar** MUST remain visible on the secondary display, and edge swipes from the configured bar edge MUST open/close the Quick Menu so users can always access navigation/actions even if no mirror-control button exists in the current layout.
- **Per-layout background settings:** Dimming parameters are stored **per layout** in `PadLayout` (not globally).
- **Background Settings Overlay** (`BackgroundSettingsOverlay`): Configures the active layout's dimming parameters, edge blending, layout-wide touch tracking, and per-cutout smoothing settings.
- **Slider Preview Mode:** Live-preview dimming value on the secondary display.
- **Dimming** (0–90%, default 0%): draws a semi-transparent black overlay on top of the mirror background.
- A special **Background Peek** action (`PadAction.BackgroundPeek`): toggles hiding all buttons and dimming.
- When the capture service is not running and ambient is enabled, the MacroPad falls back to its normal opaque rendering on the primary display.
- **Per-layout button color defaults** (`PadLayout.buttonTextColor` / `PadLayout.buttonBorderColor` / `PadLayout.buttonBgColor`): Each layout can independently configure the default colors for text/icon, border, and fading color.
  - Colors are stored using the `ColorOption` schema, which supports **Neutral Style** (neutral theme-independent palette), **Accent Color** (dynamically resolved system accent color), or a **Custom Color** (fixed ARGB).
  - Defaults are configured inside the full-screen **Layout Settings Editor** or individual button settings editor using color picker wheels and quick selection palettes featuring the 10 most recently used colors.
    - **Swords Button Preview**: Both the color picker wheel and quick selection palette display a circular preview button styled with the `swords` icon.
      - In the color wheel, the swords preview updates in real-time as the user drags to adjust the color, showing how the live-updated color looks on the target slot (text, border, or background) alongside currently configured colors on other slots.
      - In the quick selection palette, the swatches for Layout Default, Neutral, Accent, and recent colors are replaced by the same swords button preview with the respective color applied to the edited slot, keeping other slots at their currently selected values.
  - **Opacity Slider**: The custom color picker wheel incorporates an opacity/alpha slider that operates in the 10% to 100% range (`0.1f..1.0f`). Any values parsed or configured are clamped to this range.
  - **Luminance-aware Apply Button**: The "Apply" button inside the color picker dynamically changes its text color to black or white based on the luminance and transparency of the currently picked color, ensuring maximum readability.
  - **Invisible Buttons**: Both the layout settings editor and the button editor include an "Invisible Buttons" switch toggle.
    - Layout-level `invisibleButtons` acts as a default template option: when active, newly created buttons in that layout will default to having their individual `invisible` property enabled.
    - Button-level `invisible` property controls the visibility of the button in Use Mode. When true, the button is completely hidden (visually transparent) but remains fully interactive under touch input. In editing mode, the button remains visible (with the button body rendered at 40% opacity and overlaid with a small crossed-out eye in the top right corner at 100% opacity for clear distinction) so it can be customized and repositioned.
  - **Button-level overrides**: Each button can override the layout-wide color defaults individually using the same `ColorOption` fields (`PadButton.buttonTextColor`, `PadButton.buttonBorderColor`, `PadButton.buttonBgColor` for fading color). A special `null` value (shown as **Layout Default**) reverts the button back to the layout-wide default behavior.
  - Color options survive profile imports/exports and migrate legacy button color formats (`buttonColorNoMirror` / `buttonColorMirror`) automatically.


### FR-P9a: Custom Background Image

- Users can choose a **custom background image** to be displayed behind the MacroPad buttons.
- The configuration is situated in the **Layout Settings** overlay of the layout editor.
- Tapping "Choose Image" opens the system document picker (`image/*`).
- When a background image is selected, a slightly dimmed thumbnail preview of the image is shown to the left of the delete icon, with a crop icon overlaid on it. Tapping this thumbnail opens an interactive crop selector dialog in the aspect ratio of the secondary display where the user can drag to pan and pinch to zoom the background image.
- To prevent permissions from expiring and keep layouts self-contained, the chosen image is copied to the app's internal files directory as `backgrounds/bg_<layoutId>`.
- The `backgroundImagePath` parameter in `PadLayout` stores a relative path (e.g. `backgrounds/bg_<layoutId>`) along with `bgImageScale`, `bgImageOffsetX`, and `bgImageOffsetY` crop properties to maintain portability and compatibility with Megingiard's profile import/export features.
- In **Use Mode** (`PadSurface`), **Layout Editor** (`PadCanvas`), and **Mirror Presentation** (`MirrorPresentation`), the image is loaded asynchronously and rendered applying the layout's background image crop settings (scale and translations) behind the buttons.
- **Use as Mask**: The layout settings overlay includes a "Use as mask" toggle (visible only when an image is selected). When enabled (`useBackgroundImageAsMask = true`), the background image is layered *on top* of the screen mirroring cutouts but *below* the MacroPad buttons. This allows the mirrored screen regions to show through any transparent/semi-transparent windows of the background image, serving as a custom overlay frame.
- When a layout is deleted or its background image is removed/cleared, the associated image file on disk is deleted.

### FR-P9b: Per-Layout Background Touchpad

- Users can configure the open canvas space of any layout to act as a **relative mouse touchpad**, behaving similarly to the Fullscreen Virtual Touchpad.
- **Decoupled Configuration:** Background touchpad settings are stored **per layout** in `PadLayout.backgroundTouchpad` (`BackgroundTouchpadConfig`) and are independent of global touchpad settings.
- **Configurable Options:**
  - **Master Enable Switch:** Toggle background touchpad functionality for open canvas space.
  - **Pointer Sensitivity:** Pointer speed multiplier (0.1x to 3.0x).
  - **Gestures:** Toggles for Tap-to-Click, 2-Finger Tap (Right Click), 3-Finger Tap (Middle Click), and Tap-and-Drag.
  - **Scrolling:** Toggles for Two-Finger Scroll, Natural Scroll Direction, and Scroll Speed multiplier (0.5x to 3.0x).
  - **Haptics:** Toggle for haptic vibration on taps and gestures.
- **Dedicated Editor Modal:** Accessible from the **Touchpad Settings** toolbar button in `EditorToolbar` (`BackgroundTouchpadSettingsEditor`).
- **Editor Toolbar Reordering:** Toolbar buttons are ordered into three rows:
  - Row 1: `Add Button` | `Change Background`
  - Row 2: `Unlock Buttons` | `Touchpad Settings`
  - Row 3: `Change Grid`
- **Mutual Exclusion with Touch Projection:**
  - Background Touchpad and Touch Projection (screen cutout touch injection) are mutually exclusive.
  - Enabling Touch Projection on a layout displays a warning and confirmation dialog offering to turn OFF the Background Touchpad.
  - Enabling Background Touchpad when Touch Projection is active on any cutout displays a warning and confirmation dialog offering to turn OFF Touch Projection for all cutouts of that layout.

- When a profile is deleted, all background image files for its layouts are deleted.
- Creating a layout from a template layout (deep copy) automatically duplicates the background image file under the new layout's ID, ensuring that layouts do not share dependencies on the same file.

### FR-P9b: SteamGridDB Image Scraper

- Users can scrape background images directly from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) using their API v2.
- A **"Scrape from SteamGridDB"** button is provided next to the **"Browse local images"** button in the Background Settings Editor.
- When clicked, Megingiard checks if a SteamGridDB API key is configured.
  - If **no key is configured**, a warning dialog appears directing the user to create a token on SteamGridDB and providing a button that opens the **Global Settings Screen** directly.
  - If a key is configured, the **SteamGridDB Scraper** dialog opens.
- The scraper dialog automatically performs an autocomplete search for games matching the profile's name as the initial query.
- The user can modify the search query, search for games manually, select a matching game, and switch between four asset types: **Grid**, **Hero**, **Logo**, and **Icon**.
- Tapping on a preview thumbnail downloads the chosen image asynchronously, copies it to the internal files folder, and sets it as the layout's background image.
- **Scraper Error Handling**: If any network request to SteamGridDB fails while the scraping dialog is open (searching, loading images, or downloading a selected image), a dismissible `AlertDialog` is displayed to the user explaining the specific error:
  - **Being offline**: Informs the user they are offline and should check their connection.
  - **Being rate limited**: Informs the user that the rate limit was exceeded.
  - **SteamGridDB unreachable**: Informs the user that the service is down or unreachable.
  - **Other errors**: Handled with a generic error message.
- A **SteamGridDB API-Token** field is provided in the **Global Settings Screen** under the General section to allow users to input and persist their API key via DataStore.


### FR-P9c: Background Image Dimming

- Users can dim the background image using a slider in the background settings overlay.
- Dimming ranges from **0%** (no dimming) up to **90%** (maximum dimming) to prevent complete obscurity.
- Transparent and semi-transparent PNG images are fully supported: dimming is applied using a `SrcAtop` blending tint color filter. This ensures that only the non-transparent/colored pixels of the image are dimmed, and the transparent background/cutout regions remain completely unaffected.
- Real-time dimming is visible within the **Layout Settings background preview thumbnail**, the **Layout Editor Canvas** (`PadCanvas`), the active **MacroPad Screen** (`MacroPadScreen`), and the secondary display **Screen Mirror Overlay** (`MirrorPresentation`).

### FR-P15: App Launcher Button & Floating Bubble Overlay

- Users can add buttons of type **App Launcher** (`PadAction.AppLauncher`) to MacroPad layouts.
- **Single-Field Persistence**: For optimal portable layout persistence, `PadAction.AppLauncher` stores **only `packageName`** in JSON layout profiles (`{"type":"app_launcher","packageName":"..."}`). The application title and launcher icon are resolved dynamically at runtime via `PackageManager`.
- **Application Picker**: When configuring an App Launcher button in the editor, an app picker dialog lists all installed launcher applications (`PackageManager.queryIntentActivities` with `Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`), allowing the user to select an app by name or package name.
- **Editor Simplification & Dynamic Label**: Selecting the App Launcher action automatically hides the **Label** text input field and **Icon** picker from the button edit dialog (`PadButtonEditDialog`). The button label is dynamically evaluated as `"Open <AppName>"` (`"Öffnen <AppName>"` in German) derived from `PackageManager`.
- **Monochrome Tinted Icon Rendering**: The target application's launcher icon is desaturated to grayscale and rendered on the button face tinted with the user's chosen button icon color (`effectiveTextTint`).
- **Unified Button Content Rendering**: Button face contents are rendered via a unified `PadButtonContent` composable shared across Use Mode (`MacroPadButton`), Editor Canvas (`PadCanvas`), and Sidebar Button List (`ButtonListItem`), ensuring App Launcher icons are displayed consistently across all editing and usage views.
- **Execution & App Launch**: Tapping an App Launcher button opens the designated application on the bottom screen display using `ActivityOptions.makeBasic().setLaunchDisplayId(...)`.
- **Touch-Positioned Floating Bubble Overlay**: Upon launching the target application, Megingiard minimizes to the background (`moveTaskToBack(true)`) and displays a floating bubble overlay centered at the exact screen coordinates where the App Launcher button was pressed.
- **Temporary Mirroring Pause**: Triggering an App Launcher button or having an active floating bubble temporarily pauses screen capture (`ScreenCaptureService.stopSelf()`) to conserve system resources without altering the layout's saved `mirrorAutoStart` preference. Restoring Megingiard to the foreground automatically resumes screen capture.
- **Secondary Display Attachment**: The floating bubble window uses `WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY` created via `DisplayManager` targeting the secondary display (bottom screen) and managed by `MegingiardAccessibilityService`.
- **Interactivity & Restore**: The floating bubble can be freely dragged across the screen. Tapping the floating bubble restores Megingiard (`MainActivity`) to the foreground on the bottom display, dismisses the bubble, and resumes screen mirroring.



### FR-P10: Optional Button Icons

- Any button MAY be assigned an optional **icon** from the bundled **Material Symbols Rounded** icon font.
- Icons are stored as **snake_case ligature strings** (e.g. `"arrow_back"`, `"sports_esports"`, `"password_2"`) — the exact string the font's GSUB table maps to a glyph.
- When `iconName` is set:
  - In **use mode** (`MacroPadButton`): the icon is rendered centred inside the button face instead of the label text. Icon size = `43 dp × min(cols, rows)`.
  - In the **editor canvas** (`PadCanvas`, `DraggableButton`): the icon is shown at `60 dp × 0.72 × min(cols, rows)` (≈ 43 dp for 1×1).
  - In the **button list** (`MacroPadEditor`, `ButtonListItem`): the icon is shown at 18 dp in the indicator box instead of the two-character label abbreviation.
- When `iconName` is `null`, the existing label rendering is used unchanged; the label field is still stored and used in the editor button list.
- When the action type is `ScrollWheel`, `TrackpointMove`, or `BackgroundPeek`, `iconName` is forced to `null` (these action types have fixed rendering and do not support icons).
- Icon selection opens `IconPickerDialog`, a full-screen overlay with three zones:
  1. **Header** — Cancel (text button) | title | ✓ confirm (icon button).
  2. **Search row** — `AppTextField` + Filled checkbox.
  3. **Selection row** (only visible when an icon is pending) — preview box (48 dp) + icon name + "Currently selected" subtext + 🗑 delete button.
     Tapping a grid icon sets a local `pendingIcon` state (does **not** close the dialog). The user confirms with ✓ or clears via 🗑. Cancel discards any pending change.
     The icon grid is a `LazyVerticalGrid` (5 columns) of all available icons. The list (`ALL_ROUNDED_ICON_NAMES` in `RoundedIconNames.kt`) is auto-generated from the font — see _Icon Name List Generation_ in the Technical Implementation section.
- The `iconName` field defaults to `null`, so existing saved profiles load without any migration.
- No runtime reflection or Proguard keep-rules are required.

### FR-P10b: Custom Button Images & Enlarge Icon

- **Custom Button Face Images (`imageAssetId`)**:
  - Each button MAY be assigned a custom bitmap image asset (`imageAssetId: String?`), managed via `PadIconStore`.
  - When set, the button face renders the custom image cropped to a square or rounded rectangle via `PadButtonGlyph`.
  - In `PadButtonEditDialog`, an **ImagePickerSlot** is placed beside the Material Symbol picker. Tapping it opens the SAF image picker, followed by `ImageCropDialog` (1:1 square crop modal with `CropFitMode.FIT` or `CropFitMode.FILL`).
  - Cropped thumbnails are downscaled to 256×256 px, compressed to WebP lossy (90 quality), content-addressed via a 16-hex-character SHA-256 hash, and stored under `filesDir/padicons/<hash>.webp`.
  - The custom image slot features a clear (✕) button to remove the custom image at any time.
- **Enlarge Icon (`enlargeIcon`)**:
  - For buttons with a Material Symbol icon (and no custom image), an **"Enlarge icon"** toggle switch is available in `PadButtonEditDialog`.
  - When enabled (`enlargeIcon = true`), `PadGlyphRules` scales the glyph up to fill ~83% of the button face using font em metrics without clipping (`ENLARGED_EM_FRACTION = 1f`).
  - Table Mode (`isGridMode = true`) defaults `enlargeIcon` to `true` for newly assigned icons; Free Mode defaults to `false`.

### FR-P11: Default Icons and Labels for Special Action Buttons

- When a new button is created (or the action type is changed while the label field is still blank), the editor MUST pre-fill `label` and `iconName` with sensible defaults for action types that do not manage their own label.
- Defaults are defined via two package-level extension functions in `core/…/macropad/MacroPadLayout.kt`:
  - `fun PadAction.defaultLabel(): String` — returns a short English label suggestion.
  - `fun PadAction.defaultIconName(): String?` — returns a Material Symbols Rounded ligature name, or `null` if no default applies.
- Default mapping:

  | `PadAction`             | Default label       | Default icon    |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
  | `LayoutNext`            | Next Layout         | `arrow_forward` |
  | `LayoutPrevious`        | Prev Layout         | `arrow_back`    |
  | `ProfileSwitcher`       | Switch Profile      | `swap_horiz`    |
  | `MirrorPlayStop`        | Mirror              | `cast`          |
  | `MirrorFreeze`          | Freeze              | `pause_circle`  |
  | `MirrorViewportEdit`    | Viewport            | `crop_free`     |
  | `MirrorTouchProjection` | Touch Projection    | `touch_app`     |
  | `FullScreenMouse`       | Mouse               | `mouse`         |
  | `FullScreenKeyboard`    | Keyboard            | `keyboard`      |
  | `Macro`                 | _(from macro name)_ | `smart_button`  |
  | All others              | _(empty)_           | _(null)_        |

- `ScrollWheel`, `TrackpointMove`, and `BackgroundPeek` are excluded — they have fixed rendering and do not use labels or icons.

### FR-P12: Grouped Action Dropdown in Button Editor

- `PadActionPicker` MUST provide a grouped action selection flow in `ButtonEditDialog`.
- The first dropdown selects the action **group** (`Keyboard`, `Gamepad`, `Mouse`, `Macro`, `Layout`, `Mirror`, `Profile`, `Other`).
- The second dropdown selects the concrete action inside the currently selected group. **If the selected group only has a single enabled concrete action, this second dropdown is hidden, and that action is automatically selected in the background.**
- Group and action labels MUST come from `strings.xml` resources.
- Existing action-specific inline editors (keyboard modifier slots, gamepad extra-button slots, macro picker) MUST remain unchanged and appear after action selection.
- `KeyboardKey` and `GamepadButton` are excluded — they manage their own labels via the key/button name.
- **Behaviour in `ButtonEditDialog`:**
  - On dialog open (new button with `initialAction`): `initLabel` and `initIconName` are derived from the defaults before any state is initialised.
  - On action type change (`onActionChanged`): defaults are applied whenever `button == null` (new button) or the label field is blank.
  - The user can override both label and icon at any time after the default is applied.
- **No migration required:** existing saved buttons are unaffected; `iconName` defaults to `null` on deserialisation.

### FR-P13: Global Gamepad Button Label Swap (A/B and X/Y)

- Global Settings MUST provide one boolean toggle: **Swap face button labels (A/B and X/Y)** (default: off).
- When enabled:
  - `BTN_SOUTH` (physical A) is shown as **"B / Cross / South"** (EN) / **"B / Kreuz / Unten"** (DE), short label **"B"**.
  - `BTN_EAST` (physical B) is shown as **"A / Circle / East"** (EN) / **"A / Kreis / Rechts"** (DE), short label **"A"**.
  - `BTN_NORTH` (physical Y) is shown as **"X / Triangle / North"** (EN) / **"X / Dreieck / Oben"** (DE), short label **"X"**.
  - `BTN_WEST` (physical X) is shown as **"Y / Square / West"** (EN) / **"Y / Quadrat / Links"** (DE), short label **"Y"**.
- The swap is **display-only**: injected keycodes (`BTN_SOUTH`, `BTN_EAST`, `BTN_NORTH`, `BTN_WEST`) are never changed.
- The localized 3-part labels are used consistently in:
  - `GamepadButtonPicker` (MacroPad button action picker)
  - `MacroStepEditDialog` (gamepad step dropdown)
  - `MacroTimelineEditor` step list for `GamepadButtonTap`
- When the user selects a button from the picker, the **swapped short label** is stored in `PadAction.GamepadButton.label` / `MacroStep.GamepadButtonTap.label`.
- Persisted in DataStore under the `macropad_settings` export section (`gamepad_swap_face_buttons` key) and therefore included in config export/import.
- Implementation: `SettingsManager` exposes `gamepadSwapFaceButtons` as read-only `StateFlow<Boolean>`. `PadActionDisplay.kt` provides shared label helpers (`gamepadCodeDisplayLabel`, `gamepadCodeDisplayShortLabel`, `localizedDisplayLabel`) that are consumed by button picker, macro step editor, and macro timeline UI.

### FR-P14: Per-Button Haptic Feedback

- Each `PadButton` carries a `hapticStrength: HapticStrength` field (serialised; default `OFF` — existing profiles load without migration).
- Five strength levels are available: `OFF`, `LIGHT`, `MEDIUM`, `STRONG`, `CUSTOM`.
- The strength selector is displayed in `ButtonEditDialog` as a dropdown (`AppDropdown`). It is grouped with the button shape and size settings in a single row for normal buttons (or alongside trackpoint size/scrollwheel size settings). It is shown for all action types, including `BackgroundPeek`, `TrackpointMove`, and `ScrollWheel`.
- When haptics are enabled (`LIGHT`, `MEDIUM`, `STRONG`, or `CUSTOM`), two sliders appear beneath the chip row:
  - **Duration** — 1 to 200 ms (integer steps)
  - **Amplitude** — 5 to 100 in steps of 5 (20 discrete user-facing values; the value is mapped proportionally to Android's 1–255 amplitude range, so 100 maps to 255)
  - The values are stored in `PadButton.hapticCustomDurationMs` (default 10) and `PadButton.hapticCustomAmplitude` (default 25).
  - A **"Test vibration"** `TextButton` appears below the sliders and immediately fires `triggerHaptic()` using the current slider values, allowing the user to feel the selected pulse before saving.
- **Button-down (all non-trackpoint / non-scroll actions):** A single short vibration tick fires on button press. Duration / amplitude:
  - `LIGHT` — 15 ms, amplitude 64 (≈ 25 % of 255).
  - `MEDIUM` — 15 ms, amplitude 128 (≈ 50 % of 255).
  - `STRONG` — 15 ms, amplitude 255 (100 % of 255).
  - `CUSTOM` — user-configured duration (1–200 ms) and amplitude (5–100 user scale, mapped linearly to 1–255), clamped in `triggerHaptic()`.
- **TrackpointMove:** Vibration fires continuously while the finger moves, with a **speed-adaptive rate**: the faster the trackpoint moves, the shorter the interval between pulses. The engine passes `sqrt(dx² + dy²)` as a magnitude to the callback; `PadSurface` computes `interval = clamp(2000 / magnitude, 50 ms, 333 ms)`. Slow movement (magnitude ≈ 6) → ~333 ms interval; fast movement (magnitude ≥ 40) → 50 ms minimum.
- **ScrollWheel:** One tick fires per discrete scroll batch (no speed-adaptive throttle). Each batch represents a fixed number of scroll units dispatched in one gesture step.
- **Discrete button press:** magnitude is always `0f`; the interval guard evaluates to 0 ms so the pulse fires immediately regardless of prior activity.
- **Disabled-device buttons:** No haptic is triggered — the engine returns early before the callback is invoked.
- **Implementation:** `MacroPadHitTestEngine` receives an `onHapticFeedback: ((String, HapticStrength, Int, Int, Float) -> Unit)?` constructor parameter (args: buttonId, strength, customDurationMs, customAmplitude, magnitude). The `PadSurface` composable in `MacroPadScreen.kt` resolves a `Vibrator` from the system service and passes a per-button rate-limiting closure that computes the dynamic interval. `triggerHaptic()` in `HapticFeedback.kt` (`:app`) performs the `VibrationEffect.createOneShot()` call, clamping custom params to safe ranges. The `:domain` module remains Android-UI-free; only `HapticStrength` (an enum in `:core`) crosses the boundary.

### FR-P15: App-Aware Automatic Profile Switching

- The MacroPad MUST support **App-Aware Automatic Profile Switching**, where launching a mapped application on the primary screen automatically triggers a switch to its associated MacroPad profile on the secondary screen.
- **Profile Association:** Each `PadProfile` stores an optional `association: ProfileAssociation?` mapping representing the target application or a specific ROM. `ProfileAssociation` contains a `packageName` (base app or emulator package), an optional `systemId`, and an optional `romFileName`.
- **Foreground App Detection:** To achieve immediate transitions with zero latency and zero polling CPU/battery overhead, Megingiard registers an event-driven `MegingiardAccessibilityService` that observes window focus change events (`TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED`).
- **Privacy Protections:** The Accessibility Service is configured to filter specifically for window state changes (`typeWindowStateChanged`) and explicitly disables scraping or reading window content (`canRetrieveWindowContent="false"`).
- **Self-Exclusion & Transient System Guards:** Automatic profile transitions MUST ignore focus changes inside Megingiard's own package (`com.stormpanda.megingiard`) to prevent self-exclusion loops (ensuring users can edit layouts or adjust settings without the active profile switching out contextually). Additionally, transient focus transitions for core system packages—specifically `com.android.systemui` (the status bar and system overlays) and `android` (system dialogs)—MUST be ignored so that temporary system interactions do not overwrite or lose the active foreground application context.
- **Default Enabled Auto-Switching:** Automatic profile switching is enabled by default. Profile associations automatically trigger when mapped applications or ROMs gain focus.
- **Emulator Detection Funnel & ROM-Aware Switching:**
  - Automatic profile switching supports **Emulator & ROM Granularity** via `EmulatorDetectionFunnel` (`:domain`).
  - When a registered emulator or container package (e.g. `com.retroarch`, `app.gamenative`) enters the foreground, `MegingiardAccessibilityService` routes the package to `EmulatorDetectionFunnel`.
  - `EmulatorDetectionFunnel` forwards the event to `RetroArchDetector` (which queries `content_history.lpl` playlist files), `Pcsx2AndroidDetector` (which queries `recent_games.json` files for PCSX2-derived PS2 emulators like ARMSX2, AetherSX2, and NetherSX2), or `GameNativeDetector` (which queries active processes via the privileged daemon's `LIST_PROCESSES` command, falling back to reading `wine_logs/wine.log` logs via `PrivdClient` to parse the active Steam app ID or container game name if the daemon is unavailable).
  - `AutoSwitchCoordinator` performs cascading matching using `PadProfile.matches`: it searches for ROM-specific profile associations matching `packageName`, `systemId` and `romFileName` first, and falls back to generic app profiles (matching `packageName` with a null `romFileName`).
- **Service Verification & Direct Setup:** The Global Settings UI displays the active accessibility service status using a premium indicator bubble mirroring the Privileged Mode card. The system service status is polled exactly once upon accessing or resuming the Global Settings screen, and provides a manual refresh button if the service is currently inactive. The entire settings row remains clickable in all states to navigate directly to Android's system Accessibility settings screen.
- **Launcher App Picker Overlay:** The Profile Editor inside the MacroPad Editor replaces the simple text rename dialog with a unified `InlineProfileSettingsOverlay`. The overlay includes a search-filtered list of launcher applications compiled in the background (using `PackageManager.queryIntentActivities` with `Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`) to exclude internal services and background system apps. If the accessibility service is currently inactive, the app mapping picker area is greyed out and displays a descriptive warning: *"Accessibility service must be activated in Global Settings"*, preventing further application assignments until the service is active. Tapping a listed launcher application binds its package to the profile, and a "Clear App Mapping" option is available to remove the mapping.

### FR-P16: Entity Duplication and Copying

- **Name Collision Formatting**: All copy and duplication operations MUST avoid adding a `(Copy)` suffix. Instead, standard conflict resolution numbering (e.g. `Combo (2)` or `Lay1 (2)`) is appended on name collision. If no collision occurs, the original name is kept.
- **Contextual Dropdowns ("...")**: Individual action buttons in management bars and lists are merged into unified contextual "..." dropdown menus to keep the editor interface clean:
  - **Profiles**: Edit, Duplicate, and Reorder options are accessed via a "..." dropdown in the profiles management row. Duplicating a profile deep-copies all its layouts and macros, and maps macro IDs within layout buttons.
  - **Layouts**: Edit, Duplicate, Copy to Profile, and Reorder options are accessed via a "..." dropdown in the layouts management bar. Duplicating a layout clones all its buttons with new UUIDs within the active profile.
  - **Button List**: Each item in the button list replaces the individual Delete button with a "..." dropdown providing Edit, Duplicate, Copy to Layout, and Delete options. Drag-reorder handles remain separate.
  - **Dialogs & Overlays**: Property configuration dialogs (e.g., `ButtonEditDialog`) and inline configuration overlays (e.g., `InlineLayoutSettingsOverlay`) remain focused strictly on metadata settings editing, without copy or duplicate options.

#### Background Display Rendering Pipeline

When Background Display is enabled and `ScreenCaptureService` is capturing:

1. `MirrorPresentation` detects `mode == MACROPAD && ambientEnabled && isCapturing` and renders `BackgroundMacroPadOverlay` in its `ComposeView`.
2. The `SurfaceView` receives the `VirtualDisplay` output directly (live hardware path — no PixelCopy overhead).
3. A dim overlay (`Color.Black.copy(alpha = ambientDim)`) is drawn on top.

4. `PadSurface` (extracted as `internal` from `MacroPadScreen`) renders the MacroPad buttons with `transparentBackground = true`.
5. When `isPeekActive` is true, only `BackgroundPeek` buttons are rendered (the Press hit-test list is also filtered to `BackgroundPeek` buttons so hidden buttons cannot be triggered), and dim is overridden to 0.
   - **Peek state reset:** `MacroPadState.resetPeek()` is called in two places: in `BackgroundMacroPadOverlay`'s `DisposableEffect.onDispose` (leaving background display mode), and in `MacroPadScreen`'s `DisposableEffect.onDispose` (leaving MacroPad mode entirely). This ensures peek state never leaks across mode switches, regardless of which screen was active when the mode changed.

#### App-Aware Auto-Switching Architecture

1. **Accessibility Service Event Flow**:
   - `MegingiardAccessibilityService` extends `android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService`.
   - When a focus change occurs, `onAccessibilityEvent` is triggered with `TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED`.
   - The service extracts `event.packageName?.toString()` and forwards it to `AutoSwitchCoordinator.onPackageChanged()`.
2. **AutoSwitchCoordinator Filtering & Mapping**:
   - The coordinator (an `object` singleton in `:domain`) normalizes the package name.
   - It performs the self-exclusion check: if the package name is `"com.stormpanda.megingiard"`, it ignores it.
   - It performs the transient package check: package transitions matching `IGNORED_PACKAGES` (`com.android.systemui`, `android`) or `IGNORED_PACKAGE_PREFIXES` (`com.odin.`, `com.google.android.gms`, `com.google.android.play.games`) are ignored so system UI focus shifts and Google Play Games sign-in/achievement overlays do not corrupt active foreground mappings.
   - **Focus Collision Guard**: If an integration client is active and has reported a focused game, focus events matching the launcher client's package or emulator container packages are ignored when the active profile matches the focused game and ROM. This prevents launcher focus shifts or emulator container events from overriding the active game profile.
   - **Auto-Deactivation Fallback**: If an integration client is active, but the focused package changes to something other than the client, the active game, or system ignored packages (e.g., the user switched to Google Chrome), the coordinator automatically deactivates the integration client state in `AppStateManager`.
   - It searches for a matching profile in `MacroPadState.profiles` using `PadProfile.matches` against the normalized package name and any active ROM session details.
   - If a matching profile is found, and it is not already active, `MacroPadState.setActiveProfileId()` is invoked to switch the active profile immediately.

### Data Model

`PadProfile` and all sub-types are `@Serializable` data classes (sealed class `PadAction` with `@SerialName` discriminators). The full list of profiles is serialised to a single JSON string stored in DataStore under the key `macropad_profiles`. The active profile ID is stored separately under `macropad_active_profile_id`.

**Macro data model:**

Macros are stored **per profile** in `PadProfile.macros: List<Macro>`. There are no folders — macros form a flat list.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class Macro(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val steps: List<MacroStep> = emptyList(),
    val loopEnabled: Boolean = false,
    val loopPauseMs: Int = 0,
    val randomizeTimingEnabled: Boolean = false,
    val randomizeTimingRangeMs: Int = 20,
)
```

**`MacroListEditor` rendering model:**

```
MacroListEditor
  └── MacroListView (flat LazyColumn)
        ├── MacroRow... (drag-reorder via ReorderableItem)
        └── [New Macro] chip at bottom
```

Context menu actions per macro row: Edit, Duplicate, Delete.

**`MacroPicker` in `PadActionPicker`** uses a dropdown listing all macros in the active profile (pre-selecting the currently assigned macro, if any), an "Edit" button to modify the selected macro's timeline, and a "New" button to create a blank macro and immediately open it in the timeline editor.

### MacroPadMediaRepository (`:app`)

`MacroPadMediaRepository` is an `object` singleton in `app/…/macropad/` that encapsulates all filesystem and bitmap storage operations for MacroPad layout backgrounds.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `loadScaledBitmap(context, relativePath)` | Safely reads and decodes a scaled bitmap for `relativePath` under `context.filesDir` on `Dispatchers.IO`. |
| `saveBackgroundImage(context, layoutId, srcUri)` | Scales and saves `srcUri` to `backgrounds/bg_[layoutId]` as WebP on `Dispatchers.IO`. |
| `deleteBackgroundImage(context, layoutId)` | Deletes `backgrounds/bg_[layoutId]` if it exists on `Dispatchers.IO`. |
| `duplicateBackgroundImage(context, originalLayoutId, newLayoutId)` | Copies background file during layout or profile duplication on `Dispatchers.IO`. |

### Icon Rendering — Material Symbols Font

Icons are rendered using the **Material Symbols Rounded** variable font bundled at
`companion/ui/src/main/res/font/material_symbols_rounded.ttf`.

**How it works:**
The font uses OpenType GSUB ligature substitution (type 4, wrapped in type-7 Extension
lookups). When a `Text()` composable renders the string `"arrow_back"`, the HarfBuzz
shaper matches it against the GSUB ligature table and replaces the character sequence
with the single icon glyph — exactly like rendering an emoji by name.

**`MaterialSymbols.kt`** provides:

- `MaterialSymbolsFamily` — a `FontFamily` pointing at the bundled TTF with font
  variation axes locked to: `FILL=1` (filled style), `wght=400`, `GRAD=0`, `opsz=24`.
- `MaterialSymbol(name, size, tint, modifier)` — a `@Composable` that renders
  `name` (snake_case) directly as `Text()` with `MaterialSymbolsFamily`. No string
  conversion is performed; the exact stored value is passed to the font.

**Icon name format:** Snake_case (e.g. `"arrow_back"`, `"sports_esports"`,
`"password_2"`, `"android_wifi_4_bar_plus"`). This is the native format of the
Material Symbols ligature table — no PascalCase conversion is applied anywhere.

**`MaterialIconRegistry`** is kept for its `searchIcons(query)` function only
(powers the search field in `IconPickerDialog`). The old reflection-based `resolve()`
method has been removed.

### Icon Name List Generation

The searchable icon list (`ALL_ROUNDED_ICON_NAMES` in `RoundedIconNames.kt`) is
auto-generated from the bundled font file — **do not edit it manually**.

To regenerate after updating the font:

```bash
# One-time setup (Python 3.10+):
pip install fonttools

# From the repo root:
python3 scripts/generate_icon_names.py
```

The script (`scripts/generate_icon_names.py`) reads every GSUB ligature entry from
`companion/ui/src/main/res/font/material_symbols_rounded.ttf`, filters entries matching
`[a-z][a-z0-9_]+`, and writes the sorted snake_case list to `RoundedIconNames.kt`.
The generated file is version-controlled; the script only needs to be re-run when
the font file is updated.

### Native Binaries

Two new native binaries are introduced:

**`gamepadinjector_arm64`** — Creates a `BUS_VIRTUAL` uinput gamepad device and accepts commands on stdin:

- `GD <btnCode>\n` — button down
- `GU <btnCode>\n` — button up
- `HD <axis> <value>\n` — D-Pad hat event (axis 0 = X, 1 = Y; value −1/0/+1)
- `JS <axisCode> <value>\n` — analog joystick axis (axisCode: 0=ABS_X, 1=ABS_Y, 2=ABS_Z, 5=ABS_RZ; value −32768…32767)
- `R\n` on stdout when ready

Supported button codes: `BTN_SOUTH (304)`, `BTN_EAST (305)`, `BTN_NORTH (308)`, `BTN_WEST (307)`, `BTN_TL (310)`, `BTN_TR (311)`, `BTN_TL2 (312)`, `BTN_TR2 (313)`, `BTN_THUMBL (317)`, `BTN_THUMBR (318)`, `BTN_START (315)`, `BTN_SELECT (314)`, `BTN_MODE (316)`.

**`mouseinjector_arm64`** — Creates a `BUS_VIRTUAL` uinput mouse device and accepts commands on stdin:

- `MB L|R|M D|U\n` — mouse button down/up
- `MM dx dy\n` — relative move (REL_X, REL_Y)
- `MW delta\n` — scroll wheel (REL_WHEEL)
- `R\n` on stdout when ready

MOVE events (`MM`) are coalesced in the writer thread (keep-latest) to avoid latency backlog during trackpoint drag.

When the MacroPad is rendered as an ambient overlay inside `MirrorPresentation`, the Presentation window follows the same focus policy. This preserves pointer capture both with and without active mirroring.

### State Management

`MacroPadState` is an `object` singleton following the project-wide pattern:

```kotlin
object MacroPadState {
    private val _profiles = MutableStateFlow<List<PadProfile>>(emptyList())
    val profiles: StateFlow<List<PadProfile>> = _profiles.asStateFlow()

    private val _activeProfileId = MutableStateFlow<String?>(null)
    val activeProfileId: StateFlow<String?> = _activeProfileId.asStateFlow()

    val activeProfile: StateFlow<PadProfile?> = combine(_profiles, _activeProfileId) { … }
        .stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, null)

    val activeLayout: StateFlow<PadLayout?> = combine(activeProfile, _activeLayoutId) { … }
        .stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, null)

    // Profile CRUD: addProfile, updateProfile, deleteProfile, renameProfile, setActiveProfileId
    // Layout CRUD: addLayout, updateLayout, deleteLayout, reorderLayouts, setEnabled, previous/nextLayout, setActiveLayoutId
    // Macro CRUD:  addMacro, updateMacro, deleteMacro, renameMacro, reorderMacros
    // All mutations call MacroPadSettings.saveMacroPadData()
    // withSyncedDeviceFlags() auto-derives enable* flags from buttons across all enabled layouts
}
```

`SettingsManager` loads profiles on `init` via `MacroPadState.loadFrom()` and exposes `saveMacroPadData()` for any mutation. The `loadFrom()` method performs two-step migration: (1) legacy `hasTrackpoint` → `TrackpointMove` button, (2) legacy flat `buttons` list → single `PadLayout`.

### Injector Lifecycle in MacroPadScreen

Only the injectors for **enabled devices** in the active profile are started when entering MacroPad mode:

```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
    AppStateManager.overlayVisible.first { !it }
    withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        val ap = MacroPadState.activeProfile.value
        if (ap?.enableKeyboard != false) KeyInjector.start(context)
        if (ap?.enableGamepad != false) GamepadInjector.start(context)
        if (ap?.enableMouse != false) MouseInjector.start(context)
    }
}

DisposableEffect(Unit) {
    onDispose {
        KeyInjector.stop()
        GamepadInjector.stop()
        MouseInjector.stop()
    }
}
```

The same conditional logic applies in `MacroPadEditor`'s `DisposableEffect`, which restarts only enabled injectors when the editor is dismissed. The same stop/restart pattern is also used by `QuickMenu` and `BackgroundSettingsOverlay` — injectors are stopped while these modals are open so the Android soft IME can appear for text input fields. `BackgroundMacroPadOverlay` additionally observes `isQuickMenuOpen` and stops/restarts injectors when the QuickMenu opens from inside the Presentation window.

### Hit Testing

In use mode, all button hit testing (including `TrackpointMove` buttons) uses an **axis-aligned bounding box** check in the `pointerInput` handler. The bounding box is centred at `(btn.posX * w, btn.posY * h)` with dimensions derived from the button's logical size:

- Regular buttons: `MP_BUTTON_UNIT_DP × buttonSize.cols` by `MP_BUTTON_UNIT_DP × buttonSize.rows`
- TrackpointMove buttons: `MP_BUTTON_UNIT_DP × tpSize.multiplier` square

AABB hit detection is conservative for circular buttons (slightly over-accepts at corners) but this is acceptable for a game-pad-style UI.

### Pad Canvas Sizing

The pad surface occupies the full screen with **no padding** (`MP_SCREEN_PADDING = 0.dp` in `MacroPadScreen.kt`) — the pad extends to all four screen edges with no corner radius. No aspect-ratio constraint is applied; the pad grows or shrinks with the available display area.

The layout editor's `PadCanvas` reads the screen dimensions from `LocalConfiguration.current` and sets an explicit `width`/`height` of `screenWidth × screenHeight` — **pixel-identical** to the use-mode pad. Because button positions are stored as normalised coordinates [0.0, 1.0], any button placed in the editor maps to the exact same physical pixel in use mode, enabling true 1:1 WYSIWYG layout design.

### Layout Editor

`MacroPadEditor` is rendered as a full-screen in-tree overlay (`Box` inside the same composition), controlled by UI state in the hosting screen. No separate `Dialog` window is created — this is intentional so that the editor works correctly both in the main `Activity` and inside `MirrorPresentation` (secondary display), where `AlertDialog`/`Dialog` would crash with `BadTokenException` due to a null window token. All confirmation, selection, and name-input overlays inside `MacroPadEditor` (delete button, delete profile, rename profile, new profile, new layout, edit layout, and profile/layout selection for copies) follow the same pattern: in-tree `Box` composables (`InlineConfirmDeleteOverlay`, `InlineNameInputOverlay`, `InlineLayoutSettingsOverlay`, `ReorderProfilesOverlay`, `ReorderLayoutsOverlay`, `InlineProfileSelectionOverlay`, `InlineLayoutSelectionOverlay`) instead of `AlertDialog`, unified using a common `InlineDialogOverlay` container to ensure a consistent appearance, scrim interaction, and input blocking. Profile-level settings (shape, size) are also available directly in `MacroPadToolSettings` without opening the full editor. The editor features horizontally scrollable chip rows for both profile and layout selection (`EditorProfileChipsBar` and `EditorLayoutChipsBar`). Next to each row of chips is a "..." menu button that opens a contextual dropdown menu, enabling actions such as editing properties, duplicating, copying, deleting (when more than one item exists), and initiating full-screen drag-reordering (`ReorderProfilesOverlay` or `ReorderLayoutsOverlay`). In the profiles section, a dedicated **"Macros…"** button row (represented by an `EditorActionChip` using a playlist-play icon) is rendered directly below the profiles chips bar to manage the profile's macro library. The vertical margin between the chips and their action buttons is closely grouped for both layout and profile sections. If a profile or layout is the only one in existence, it cannot be deleted; the delete option in the "..." dropdown menu is disabled and styled with `0.38f` alpha. The Add button (plus icon) has been moved into the right-hand side of the Profile, Layout, and Buttons section separators as a premium clickable `Row` showing "+ Add", colored with the active accent color. Layout chips support drag-reordering via long press. The layout-level settings (the two button color options: no-mirror and mirror styles) are configured directly inside `InlineLayoutSettingsOverlay` rather than in the main list, and are saved atomically upon confirmation.

The editor list features an action toolbar (`EditorToolbar`) containing two rows of compact action chips:
1. **First Row**:
   - **Add Button** — opens the button configuration dialog.
   - **Change Background** — opens the dedicated background settings editor overlay to choose or delete background images, scrape cover art from SteamGridDB, crop/scale the background, or toggle mask mode.
2. **Second Row**:
   - **Unlock Buttons / Lock Buttons** — controls layout canvas editing. By default, the layout canvas is **locked** so that buttons cannot be accidentally moved or dragged. Tapping "Unlock Buttons" (displays a locked lock icon) changes the wording to "Lock Buttons" (displays an unlocked lock icon), enabling real-time drag-repositioning of buttons on the canvas.
   - **Change Grid** (styled with the active accent color at all times) — toggles grid snapping modes (`OFF`, `RECTANGULAR`, `RADIAL`).

The editor list is scrollable via `LazyColumn`.

### Grid Snap Overlay

The editor canvas supports an optional snap grid rendered behind the draggable buttons. Grid state (`GridMode` enum: `OFF`, `RECTANGULAR`, `RADIAL`) is local to the `EditorBody` composable and not persisted.

**Rendering** — A `Canvas` composable in `PadCanvas` draws the grid when mode ≠ `OFF`:

- **Rectangular:** vertical and horizontal lines at every `PC_GRID_STEP_DP` (30 dp) increment. Accent colour at 35 % alpha, 1 px stroke.
- **Radial:** concentric circles centred at `(0.5, 0.5)` with radii stepping by 30 dp. Each circle has evenly-distributed snap-point dots; the count is the nearest multiple of 4 to `round(circumference / buttonUnit)`, minimum 4, via `radialPointCount()`. Circles alternate phase: odd circles (1st, 3rd, …) have a 45° phase offset so their 4 anchor points sit at the diagonals; even circles have a 0° offset so anchors sit at the cardinal directions. A larger dot (5 dp radius) marks the canvas centre; snap-point dots are 3 dp radius. All circles and dots share the same colour: accent at 35 % alpha. No horizontal/vertical lines.

**Snapping** — During drag, the raw normalised position is passed through `snapPosition()` which delegates to `snapRectangular()` or `snapRadial()`:

- **`snapRectangular`** rounds both pixel coordinates to the nearest grid step (integer multiples of `gridStepPx`).
- **`snapRadial`** snaps the distance-from-centre to the nearest circle radius, then derives that circle's index to determine its phase offset (odd → 45°, even → 0°). The raw angle is shifted into phase-relative space before rounding to the nearest point index, then the phase offset is re-added to get the final snapped angle. The canvas centre is always a competing candidate; whichever snap target is closer to the raw position wins.

**Toggle** — A "Change Grid" toggle button placed in the second row of the editor toolbar cycles the grid mode. Icons: `GridOff` (off), `Grid4x4` (rectangular), `TripOrigin` (radial). The button uses a rounded-rectangle border that matches the chip style; the icon tint is accent-coloured when a grid is active and secondary-surface-coloured when off.
