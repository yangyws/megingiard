# Megingiard Security Concept

This document is the entry point for Megingiard's security model. It summarizes the current hardening layers and links to the detailed feature, architecture, and build documentation.

## Scope and Threat Model

Megingiard is a local, device-specific companion app for the AYN Thor. The strongest trust boundary is the Android app sandbox: the normal app process runs as an untrusted app, while Privileged Mode starts a helper daemon under the shell UID through ADB Wireless Debugging.

The current security concept focuses on these threats:

- Repackaged APKs signed by an attacker.
- Native helper binaries or mirror DEX assets swapped inside the APK or during deployment.
- A rogue process claiming the local TCP port before the real daemon.
- A rogue app connecting to the real daemon socket and sending privileged commands.
- A public APK being decompiled to extract authentication secrets.

It does not claim DRM, copy protection, network hardening, or resistance against a fully compromised device / root attacker.

## Configuration Keys

Security-sensitive build values are read from `local.properties`:

| Key                         | Meaning                                                                                                           | Required for distribution                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `megingiard.signing.sha256` | SHA-256 fingerprint of the expected APK signing certificate. Injected into `BuildConfig.EXPECTED_SIGNING_SHA256`. | Yes. Release builds abort if missing or malformed unless explicitly overridden for local testing. |

## Per-install Key Scheme

The previous scheme embedded the Privd HMAC key in `BuildConfig` at compile time. Anyone who downloads the public APK can extract that key via decompilation — without any device access. The current scheme eliminates this weakness.

**How it works:**

1. **Key generation** — During Privileged Mode bootstrap the app generates 32 random bytes with `SecureRandom`. This key is unique per install and never appears in the APK.
2. **Keystore encryption** — The key is encrypted under an AES-256-GCM key that lives in Android Keystore (`megingiard_privd_pair_key_v1`, hardware-backed when the device has a TEE or StrongBox). The ciphertext is stored in `noBackupFilesDir/privd_pair_key.enc`.
3. **Provisioning** — The app transmits the plaintext key to the daemon over the already-authenticated ADB TLS channel: `megingiard_privd --provision <key_hex> <app_uid>`. The daemon writes it to `/data/local/tmp/megingiard_privd.key` (mode 0600, shell-owned). The app UID is stored alongside the key so the daemon can enforce peer identity.
4. **Usage** — On subsequent app starts the app decrypts the key from Keystore storage (`PrivdPairKey.load()`) and loads it into `PrivdClient`. The daemon reads it from the state file at startup. The existing mutual `CHAL/AUTH/OK/VERIFY/PROOF` handshake then uses this per-install key.
5. **Uninstall invalidation** — Android destroys the Keystore AES key when the app is uninstalled. The ciphertext in `noBackupFilesDir` therefore becomes permanently unreadable after reinstall, forcing the user to re-run the setup wizard. A reinstalled app (potentially from a different source) cannot silently inherit the old daemon's trust relationship.

**Attack vectors covered by this scheme:**

| Scenario                                                   | Outcome                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public APK decompiled by an attacker                       | No key in APK — decompilation yields nothing useful                          |
| Rogue app tries to connect to the daemon                   | Daemon rejects the connection if HMAC handshake verification fails           |
| Rogue process binds the socket first, impersonating daemon | App rejects the connection if mutual HMAC verification proof fails           |
| App reinstalled (possibly from a different source)         | Keystore entry destroyed — cannot decrypt stored key — re-bootstrap required |
| Daemon binary from old install serves connections          | Old daemon has no state file → refuses to start                              |

**Security property:** Compromising only the app (without the device's Keystore) or only the daemon binary (without the state file) does not grant access to the other party's secrets.

## Verification and Tests

The current automated coverage focuses on pure cryptographic primitives:

- `BinaryIntegrityTest` covers SHA-256 known-answer vectors and sensitivity to byte changes.
- `HmacUtilTest` covers HMAC-SHA256 RFC 4231 vectors and the constant-time hex MAC comparison used for daemon `PROOF` verification.
- Agents must run `./gradlew :shared:core:test :companion:domain:test :companion:ui:testDebugUnitTest :gamefocus:ui:testDebugUnitTest` after implementation changes that affect pure `:shared:core` or `:companion:domain` logic.
- Native C source changes must be followed by the matching build script; see [Build Native](docs/BUILD_NATIVE.md#native-rebuild-policy).

Runtime Android branches such as `SignatureGuard.verify()` and the full `LocalSocket` handshake currently require manual device validation or future Robolectric / instrumentation coverage.

## Residual Risks and Future Hardening

- HMAC key rotation and signing-certificate rotation are manual re-bootstrap / redeploy operations today.
- A fully compromised / rooted device can patch code, binaries, memory, or filesystem contents outside the assumptions of this model.
- Socket parser fuzzing and end-to-end tamper tests are not yet part of automated CI.
