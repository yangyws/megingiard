/**
 * Injects keyboard events by piping commands to the native `keyinjector_arm64`
 * binary, which creates a virtual keyboard via `/dev/uinput` and writes Linux
 * `EV_KEY` events into the kernel input subsystem.
 *
 * ### Protocol
 * - `KD <linux_keycode>\n` — key down
 * - `KU <linux_keycode>\n` — key up
 *
 * Every key-down and key-up is delivered in order — no coalescing applied.
 * The binary registers KEY bits 1–255 only; codes ≥ 256 (BTN_* device buttons)
 * are rejected so Android classifies the virtual device as KEYBOARD.
