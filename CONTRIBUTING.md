## AI Agentic Development Workflow (Google Antigravity & Gemini)

The Megingiard codebase and its development workflows are heavily optimized for **Google Antigravity** using **Gemini models**. The repository contains specific configurations, system prompts, rules, and scripts designed to enable seamless pair-programming with AI coding agents.

### Custom Skills & Automated Workflows
We define custom workspace-level agentic instructions and automation scripts inside the [.agents/](.agents) directory. These are structured as "skills" that can be executed to automate or verify work:
* `megingiard-bugfix`: Coordinates diagnostics, tracing root causes, and implementing clean bug fixes on hardware.
* `megingiard-code-review`: Audits code changes against architectural layer rules, Jetpack Compose performance guidelines, and state management conventions.
* `megingiard-feature`: Guides the implementation of new user-visible features or Compose screens.
* `megingiard-pr-review-apply`: Applies changes from PR feedback and reviews documentation sync.
* `megingiard-release` & `megingiard-release-changelog`: Automates tag comparisons, changelog compilation, and version bumps.
* `pull-screenshots`: Automates capturing screenshots from both screens of physical hardware (AYN Thor) via ADB.

### Recommending Google Antigravity & Gemini
We **strongly recommend** that all contributors adopt Google Antigravity paired with Gemini models for developing contributions in this codebase. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because our formatting, logging guidelines, testing standards, and file boundaries are strictly enforced via the `.agents/` workflows and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) rules, contributions developed using alternative tooling may produce significant code alignment and style review overhead. To avoid delays in reviewing and merging your Pull Requests, aligning your agentic stack with the project's native Antigravity setup is highly encouraged.

## Code Guidelines & Conventions

To maintain codebase health and high execution performance, please adhere to the following standards defined in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md):

### 1. Architectural Integrity
Megingiard is split into modular layers:
* **`:app` (Android UI Layer):** Jetpack Compose, ViewModels, Activities, and foreground services. Place shared Composable components in `ui/`.
* **`:domain` (Business Logic & State Management):** Pure business logic, hardware interaction, and state flows. **Must not import Android UI or View elements.**
* **`:core` (Data Structures & Constants):** Pure Kotlin models, serializable schemas, and common constants. **Must have no Android framework dependencies.**

### 2. Kotlin & Compose Conventions
* **Kotlin 2.0+:** Write modern Kotlin. Use `enum.entries` (never `enum.values()`). Use `kotlin.math.min`/`max` (never `java.lang.Math.*`).
* **Imports:** Always use explicit, fully-qualified imports. **Do not use wildcard/star imports** (`import foo.*`).
* **Constants:** Extract all magic numbers to private file-scoped constants using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
* **Color Tokens:** Prefix any file-scoped Compose colors with a 2–3 letter feature code to avoid collisions (e.g. `MP_BUTTON_RED` for MacroPad).

### 3. Logging Mandate
* **Never use `android.util.Log` directly.** All logging must route through `com.stormpanda.megingiard.AppLog`.
* Add informative logs at major lifecycle milestones, state mutations, and error pathways (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for mandatory log coverage).

## Contributing Translations & Locale Support

We welcome translation contributions to make Megingiard accessible to more users worldwide! When submitting new or updated translations, please adhere to the following requirements:

### 1. Multi-Module Translation Scope
* You can provide translations for both `:app` (`companion/ui/src/main/res/values-<lang>/strings.xml`) and `:gamefocus` (`gamefocus/ui/src/main/res/values-<lang>/strings.xml`) in a single Pull Request. Maintainers develop and coordinate features across both modules simultaneously.

### 2. Mandatory Privileged Auto Setup Support
* **Strict Requirement:** Any language offered as an app translation **must** also support **Privileged Auto Setup**. (Auto Setup is permitted and welcomed to support *more* system languages than Megingiard offers UI translations for, but any language with UI translations must support Auto Setup).
* **Configuration:** You must update [`AutoSetupLanguageConfig.kt`](shared/core/src/main/kotlin/com/stormpanda/megingiard/privd/AutoSetupLanguageConfig.kt) in the `:core` module by adding a new language configuration containing:
  - BCP 47 locale tag and 2-letter ISO language code.
  - System settings search query strings for **Build Number**, **Wireless Debugging**, and **USB Debugging**.
  - Localized keyword lists for identifying the **"Pair device with pairing code"** row and dialog **"Allow" / "OK"** confirmation buttons.
* **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests for the new language config in [`AutoSetupLanguageConfigTest.kt`](shared/core/src/test/kotlin/com/stormpanda/megingiard/privd/AutoSetupLanguageConfigTest.kt) to verify locale parsing and fallback behavior.

### 3. Mandatory Permutation Testing for Auto Setup
Before submitting a translation Pull Request, you **must** manually verify that the Privileged Auto Setup workflow functions correctly across all device starting points defined by the following state permutations:
* **Developer Options:** ON vs. OFF
* **Wireless Debugging:** ON vs. OFF
* **USB Debugging:** ON vs. OFF
* **Wireless Debugging Pairing:** First-time pairing (never paired with Megingiard) vs. Previously paired
* **Interrupted / Reset Connection:** Privileged Daemon previously connected successfully, followed by a device reboot or manual deactivation of Developer Options / Wireless Debugging / USB Debugging.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Open an Issue First
**You must open a GitHub issue describing your proposed change and receive explicit approval/feedback from the maintainer before starting work.** This prevents duplicate work, ensures your proposal aligns with the architectural design, and guarantees your PR will be considered.

### Step 2: Fork and Branch
1. Fork the official Megingiard repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new descriptive branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-amazing-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/fix-mirror-crash
   ```

### Step 3: Implement, Synchronize, and Verify
1. **Sync with Upstream:** Before implementing and before submitting a PR, ensure your branch is updated to the latest commit on the upstream `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   # or merge
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
2. **Implement:** Write your code following the guidelines in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
3. **Mandatory Testing:** Run the unit tests locally before submitting any contribution to ensure there are no regressions:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```
4. **Mandatory Documentation Sync:**
   - If your changes affect a feature's behavior or settings, you **must** update the corresponding `docs/features/<feature>/FEATURE.md` documentation.
   - If user interaction behavior or settings options changed, you **must** update the corresponding help menus and `HelpModal` screens to avoid undocumented features.
5. **Hardware Verification:** If possible, verify your changes on physical hardware (e.g. AYN Thor).

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request
1. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages matching Conventional Commits.
2. Push your branch to your GitHub fork.
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of the official repository.
4. Describe your changes clearly in the PR description. If a test binary is needed, contact the maintainer to arrange sending it privately; **never** attach compiled APKs or binaries publicly in GitHub comments or issues.
