/**
 * Injects touch events by piping text commands to the native `touchinjector_arm64`
 * binary, which writes Linux Multi-Touch Protocol Type B events directly to
 * `/dev/input/event6` (the primary touchscreen node on the AYN Thor).
 *
 * ### Why a native binary
 * The native binary opens the device node once and writes `struct input_event`
 * (24-byte kernel structs) directly — no Binder IPC, yielding < 1 ms per MOVE
 * vs ~7 ms for `cmd input motionevent`.
 *
 * ### Protocol
 * `D x y\n` — finger down, `M x y\n` — move, `U x y\n` — up.
 * Coordinates are in the sensor's physical portrait space: X ∈ [0, 1080], Y ∈ [0, 1920].
 *
 * Consecutive MOVE commands are coalesced (keep-latest) to prevent backlog.
 * DOWN and UP are never dropped.
