## Functional Requirements

### Overview

Some advanced Megingiard features need to write to system input devices that
the regular app sandbox cannot reach (UID `untrusted_app`, missing the
`input` group, restrictive SELinux domain). Privileged Mode bridges that gap
by running a tiny on-device helper daemon (`megingiard_privd`) under the
**shell** UID — the same privilege envelope that ADB itself runs in. The
daemon listens on a local TCP socket loopback (`127.0.0.1:51234–51238` for release variants or `127.0.0.1:51244–51248` for debug variants); the app connects, sends ASCII
commands, and the daemon performs the privileged kernel I/O on its behalf.

No root, no third-party app, no external server: the bootstrap uses
Android's own ADB Wireless Debugging facility, which Google has shipped on
every device since Android 11 (API 30).

### FR-PV1: User Opt-In

- Privileged Mode MUST be **off by default**. The user must explicitly
  start it from Global Settings.
- Disconnecting MUST be possible at any time without affecting any other
  Megingiard feature.

### FR-PV2: Status Visibility

- The Settings card MUST show one of five states: `OFF`, `BOOTSTRAPPING`,
  `CONNECTING`, `RUNNING`, `FAILED`.
- A `Test connection` button MUST round-trip a `PING` to the daemon and
  display the result, so the user can verify the link is alive.

### FR-PV3: Automatic Feature Promotion

- All consumer features supporting Privileged Mode (Gamepad merge, physical Gamepad recording, privileged mirroring, and screenshots) MUST be automatically activated when the daemon is in the `RUNNING` state.
- When the daemon is not running (e.g., in `OFF`, `FAILED`, or disconnected states), the app MUST transparently fallback to non-privileged equivalent paths (such as virtual gamepad uinput and standard MediaProjection) without requiring manual configuration.

### FR-PV4: Setup Discoverability

- The card MUST expose a "Set up…" button that opens a fully on-device
  setup wizard. The wizard MUST guide the user through: enabling Wireless
  Debugging in Developer Options → entering host/port/code from the system
  pairing dialog → pushing and starting the daemon binary → verifying the
  connection. No external computer or USB cable is required.

- After a successful first-time setup, the app MUST silently re-open the
  daemon socket on every cold start so users do not need to re-run the
  wizard after each reboot. Auto-connect is unconditionally active, and showing
  the reconnection prompt upon daemon failure or service deactivation is standard behavior.

### FR-PV7: Mandatory Accessibility Service & Dynamic Reconnection Wizard

- Accessibility Service is **mandatory** for core Megingiard functionality (automatic game macro profile switching, system dialog dismissal, and auto-setup helper).
- An event-driven `AccessibilityStateChangeListener` and `ON_RESUME` observer monitor the service status. If Accessibility Service is deactivated in System Settings while the app is active and the Welcome Tour is not running (`!isWizardActive`), the app automatically triggers the compact Reconnection Wizard dialog.
- The Reconnection Wizard renders a multi-step dialog matching the Welcome Tour styling (`OnboardingStepper`, `AppMagicalButton`, dark backdrop scrim):
  - **Accessibility Step**: Included whenever Accessibility Service is inactive. The description states that Accessibility is mandatory for core features, and the Skip button is removed.
  - **Privileged Mode Step**: **Optional**. Excluded dynamically if Privileged Mode is already in the `RUNNING` state and only Accessibility Service is missing. Included if Privileged Mode is disconnected or in `FAILED` state.
  - **Finished Step**: Displays "You're all set!" with a "Close" finish button.

### FR-PV8: 4-Step Manual Setup Wizard & Connect Port Entry

- The manual setup wizard (`PrivdSetupWizardDialog`) renders a 4-step modal dialog on the secondary display (bottom screen) using the Welcome Tour styling (`OnboardingStepper`, `FinishedStepContent`, dark backdrop scrim, bezel card container, and smooth horizontal step transitions). When triggered from Global Settings, the primary display (top screen) settings modal is automatically closed so that Android Developer Options and Wireless Debugging on Display 0 remain visible and unobstructed:
  - **Step 1 (Menu Description)**: Displays instructions for navigating to Developer Options -> Wireless Debugging with an "Open system settings" button.
  - **Step 2 (Connect Port)**: Provides an input field for the Wireless Debugging **Connect Port** (5 digits).
  - **Step 3 (Pairing Code & Pairing Port)**: Provides input fields for **WiFi pairing code** (6 digits) and **Pairing port** (5 digits), triggering pairing and bootstrapping with live stage progress checklist.
  - **Step 4 (You're All Set)**: Reuses `FinishedStepContent` to display completion confirmation ("You're all set! Privileged Mode is ready.").
- Step 2 and Step 3 provide **Back** buttons to navigate to preceding steps, and the **Pair** button on Step 3 triggers `PrivdBootstrapper` pairing (`127.0.0.1:<PairPort>`) and bootstrap.

### FR-PV9: Multi-Stage Privileged Mode Auto-Setup & Onboarding Tour Integration

- The Privileged Mode card in Global Settings and Step 5 (`PRIVILEGED`) of the Welcome Tour MUST expose an "Auto Setup" button.
- Clicking the button MUST evaluate device setup conditions and run the appropriate automated pipeline on Display 0 via `MegingiardAccessibilityService`:
  - **Settings Task Stack Warm-Up**: To prevent transition crashes and focus collisions with the active system launcher (like Game Focus) during cold starts (e.g. immediately after a fresh device reboot), the setup pipeline MUST first launch the root Settings homepage (`Settings.ACTION_SETTINGS`) to warm up the Settings task stack. After a brief delay (e.g. 400ms), it then launches the target deep-linked sub-screen (About Phone or Developer Options).
  - **Stage A (Dev Mode Activation)**: If Developer Options are disabled, launches About Phone settings and taps "Build number" 7 times to unlock Developer Mode.
  - **Stage B (USB & Wireless Debugging Activation)**: If USB Debugging or Wireless Debugging is disabled, routes directly to Developer Options settings via `Settings.ACTION_APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS`, locates the USB debugging switch by its standardized view Resource IDs (e.g., `com.android.settings:id/switch_widget`, `android:id/switch_widget`, etc.) and toggles it `ON` (confirming warning dialogs using resource ID `android:id/button1`). To toggle Wireless Debugging, it clicks the `"Wireless debugging"` preference row to enter its sub-screen, then toggles its main switch `ON`. Activating USB Debugging is mandatory whenever Wireless Debugging is activated to ensure Wireless ADB sessions persist.
  - **Stage C (Auto-Pairing / Connection with Stored Credentials)**: If stored credentials exist, the service first attempts to connect and bootstrap the daemon using them once Wireless Debugging is activated. If that connection succeeds, the setup finishes successfully. If the connection fails (or if credentials are not present), the service clears the credentials and proceeds with the pairing dialog flow: routes directly to Developer Options settings via `Settings.ACTION_APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS`, clicks the `"Wireless debugging"` preference row to enter its sub-screen, opens the pairing dialog ("Pair device with pairing code") by locating and clicking the row matching the pairing keywords via view Resource IDs (e.g. `android:id/title`), scans text for the 6-digit code and port via `PrivdPairScreenTextScanner`, and pairs via `PrivdBootstrapper.pair()`.
  - **Full-Service Auto-Connect & App Restoration**: Upon completing pairing, the service waits for the pairing dialog to dismiss and for `adbd` keys database to stabilize (using a 1500ms delay), rescans the screen for the connect port, and automatically initiates `PrivdManager.connect()` to start the privileged daemon seamlessly. Once the daemon is connected successfully (either via stored credentials or after dynamic pairing), the service retrieves the package name of the application that was running on the top screen prior to auto setup starting (using `AutoSwitchCoordinator.foregroundApp`), and launches it back on the top screen (`Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY`). If no app was running or it was a system Settings panel, the service automatically falls back to launching the Home launcher/screen on the default display.
  - **All Set**: If Developer Mode, USB Debugging, Wireless Debugging, and ADB pairing are all active, automatically initiates `PrivdManager.connect()` if disconnected and displays a Toast notification: *"You're all set! Privileged Mode is ready."*
  - **Language-Independent Navigation**: By utilizing standardized Android system view Resource IDs (such as `com.android.settings:id/main_switch`, `android:id/switch_widget`, `android:id/title`, and dialog buttons like `android:id/button1`), settings traversal and toggling logic is inherently language-independent. The locale configuration (`AutoSetupLanguageConfig`) is used for mapping target keyword text checks (e.g. pairing dialog title matches or system warning confirmations) across German, Spanish, French, English, and Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`, `zh-HK`, `zh-MO`) system locales. If a targeted settings element is off-screen (such as the Build number row at the bottom of About Phone), the service MUST recursively find scrollable containers and execute scroll forward actions to bring them into view.
  - **Network Trust Dialog Auto-Confirmation**: If the system displays a Wireless Debugging or USB Debugging network trust confirmation dialog ("Debugging über WLAN in diesem Netzwerk zulassen?" / "USB-Debugging zulassen?"), the service MUST automatically click the positive action button ("ZULASSEN" / "ALLOW" / "OK") by looking up the resource IDs (e.g. `android:id/button1` or `com.android.settings:id/button1`) while strictly ignoring checkable CheckBox nodes.
- Step 5 of the Welcome Tour MUST render a live status checklist displaying stage progress icons (`PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `DONE`) for Developer Options, Wireless Debugging, ADB Pairing, and Daemon Connection.
- If the Accessibility Service is inactive, clicking the button MUST display a helpful Toast notification and launch system Accessibility settings.


### FR-PV5: No Always-Connected Requirement

- The app MUST function fully when Privileged Mode is OFF. Every feature
  that integrates with Privileged Mode MUST have a working non-privileged
  fallback.

## Features That Require Privileged Mode

| Feature                                      | What it gains                                                                                 | Without Privileged Mode                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gamepad merge** (MacroPad → physical pad)  | Single-controller emulation: games see only one controller.                                   | Falls back to a virtual uinput gamepad. Most games still recognise both, but a few (e.g. some Steam Big Picture flows) only accept the first-connected device. |
| **Macro subsystem** (execution, recording, editing) | Low-latency physical controller & touch capture directly over running games; hardware evdev input injection. | Blocked with proactive UI feedback: use-mode buttons show disabled styling with floating warning banners; editor decks display warning banners and prevent recording / execution. |

DRM content keeps working.                                                  |
| **Relative mouse** (Touchpad / Keyboard)     | Low-latency, scheduler-boosted mouse events. Shell UID execution prevents cursor lag under CPU contention. | Falls back to spawning a local virtual mouse binary (`mouseinjector_arm64`) as an app subprocess. |
| **Virtual keyboard** (Keyboard)             | Low-latency, scheduler-boosted keystrokes. Shell UID execution prevents typing lag under CPU contention.   | Falls back to spawning a local virtual keyboard binary (`keyinjector_arm64`) as an app subprocess. |
| **Touch injection** (Touchpad / Mirror)      | Low-latency, scheduler-boosted multi-touch events. Shell UID handles group permissions directly. | Falls back to spawning a local touch injector binary (`touchinjector_arm64`) as an app subprocess. |

### Bootstrap (Meilenstein B — on-device wizard)

The wizard performs the entire bootstrap on the device itself, using
[libadb-android](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/libadb-android) and an
in-app generated RSA 2048 / X.509 self-signed certificate.

Flow:

1. **Wizard step 1** shows step-by-step instructions for enabling Wireless
   Debugging (Developer Options unlock → Wireless Debugging ON → "Pair device
   with pairing code"). An "Open system settings" button dynamically routes the
   user to settings on the primary display (`Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY`):
   - If Developer Options are enabled, it attempts to open the **Wireless Debugging**
     screen directly (via the `android.service.quicksettings.action.QS_TILE_PREFERENCES`
     intent targeting the wireless debugging tile component), falling back to the
     main **Developer Options** screen (`Settings.ACTION_APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS`),
     and finally to general **Settings** (`Settings.ACTION_SETTINGS`).
   - If Developer Options are disabled, it goes directly to general **Settings**
     (`Settings.ACTION_SETTINGS`) so the user can navigate to the About page and unlock it.
2. **Wizard step 2** collects host (IP), port (5-digit), and 6-digit
   pairing code from the system dialog and calls
   `PrivdAdbConnectionManager.pair(host, port, code)`. Pairing speaks the
   ADB pairing protocol over TLS, no internet involved.
3. **Wizard step 3** triggers `PrivdBootstrapper.bootstrapAndConnect()`
   which goes through the `BootstrapStage` machine:
   `CONNECTING_ADB → PUSHING_BINARY → SPAWNING_DAEMON → VERIFYING → DONE`.
   - `CONNECTING_ADB` calls `AbsAdbConnectionManager.connect(host, connectPort)`
     using the IP address and connect port the user entered in wizard step 2
     (the port shown next to the IP on the main "Wireless debugging" screen —
     distinct from the pairing port). Direct connect is used instead of mDNS
     (`autoConnect()`) because mDNS self-discovery is unreliable on-device on
     the AYN Thor.
   - `PUSHING_BINARY` opens the ADB `sync:` service, sends the daemon asset
     with `SEND` / `DATA` / `DONE`, waits for `OKAY`, then issues `STAT` and
     verifies the remote byte size matches the bundled asset before continuing.
     The same step also pushes `megingiard_mirror.dex` to
     `/data/local/tmp/megingiard_mirror.dex` (mode `0100644`) — required by
     the privileged-mirror path (FR-M9). DEX push failure is logged as a
     warning but does not abort bootstrap; the standard MediaProjection mirror
     remains available as a fallback.
   - `SPAWNING_DAEMON` opens a fresh stream and runs
     `/data/local/tmp/megingiard_privd </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &` — the
     daemon detaches via `setsid()` + `signal(SIGHUP, SIG_IGN)` and
     survives the AdbStream close.
   - `VERIFYING` retries `PrivdManager.connect()` up to 20 times with a
     500 ms initial delay followed by 300 ms between retries (up to 6.5 s
     total) to absorb the race between the daemon's `bind()` and the
     app's `connect()`.
4. **Wizard step 4** confirms success and toggles `privdAutoConnect = true`.

The RSA key (PKCS#8) and X.509 certificate are persisted as raw bytes in
`noBackupFilesDir/privd_adb_key.bin` and `noBackupFilesDir/privd_adb_cert.bin`
(using `Context.noBackupFilesDir` to exclude them from Auto Backup / device-to-device
transfer). To prevent trust database collisions in the system `adbd` daemon when
re-pairing, the device name is generated with a random 4-character suffix (e.g.
`Megingiard-abcd`) and stored in `privd_device_name.txt`. This unique name is used
as the CN in the self-signed X.509 certificate (SHA512withRSA, ~30-year validity).
On credential regeneration or deletion, the `libadb-android` library's static
`SslUtils.sslContext` cache is cleared via reflection to ensure the new certificate
and private key are loaded successfully by subsequent TLS connections.

Key pair generation uses `SecureRandom()` (not a named algorithm) for the
RSA key-pair initializer, and `SecureRandom().nextInt() and Int.MAX_VALUE`
for the X.509 serial number, ensuring a cryptographically-strong positive value.

The daemon binary in `/data/local/tmp` survives until reboot; thereafter, the next start of the app (or auto-connect invocation) replays the push/spawn step in the background if the user previously completed the setup wizard.

### Auto-Connect Hook

Auto-connect is mandatory and always active on app startup. The user toggle and its datastore preference `privdAutoConnect` have been completely removed from the codebase.

`MainActivity.onCreate()` installs a long-lived collector to automatically start or re-bootstrap the daemon:

```kotlin
PrivdManager.state.collect { state ->
  when {
    state == PrivdState.RUNNING -> triggered = false
    (state == PrivdState.OFF || state == PrivdState.FAILED) && !triggered && !PrivdManager.isManuallyDisconnected -> {
      triggered = true
      AppLog.i(TAG, "Auto-connecting Privileged Mode")
      withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { PrivdManager.connect(applicationContext) }
    }
  }
}
```

When `PrivdManager.connect(context)` is invoked:
1. It first attempts a direct local TCP socket connection (scanning port range `51234–51238` for release or `51244–51248` for debug) via `PrivdClient.connect()`.
2. If this fails (e.g. after a reboot when the daemon process has terminated), it checks if saved ADB credentials (`privd_adb_key.bin` and `privd_adb_cert.bin`) exist in the `noBackupFilesDir` folder.
3. If they exist, it automatically starts a background ADB bootstrap via `PrivdBootstrapper.bootstrapAndConnect(context, "127.0.0.1")` which reads the dynamic ADB Wireless Debugging port (using screen-scanned or NSD fallbacks if necessary), connects to the local ADB server trying multiple loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) to handle system IP binding preferences, pushes and spawns the daemon, and connects the socket.

The `triggered` guard ensures auto-connect runs at most once for a given
OFF/FAILED transition and therefore cannot spin in a tight retry loop when the
daemon is unreachable. The guard resets when Privileged Mode reaches `RUNNING`.
This lets the app recover from a dropped or manually killed daemon after an
update: `RUNNING → FAILED` triggers one fresh connect attempt, so the newly
deployed daemon binary can be picked up without a full app restart.

### Wireless Debugging & Credentials Status Check

To guide users when Privileged Mode is offline, `GlobalSettingsViewModel` exposes a reactive background checker `checkPrivilegedModeStatus(context)`. The settings card triggers this check via a `LaunchedEffect(state)` on entering the Global Settings screen and whenever the connection state changes.

`GlobalSettingsViewModel` delegates these checks to domain singletons:
1. **Credentials Presence:** `PrivdBootstrapper.hasCredentials(context)` verifies if the local ADB pairing files (`privd_adb_key.bin` and `privd_adb_cert.bin`) exist in `noBackupFilesDir`.
2. **Wireless Debugging Activity:** `PrivdBootstrapper.isWirelessDebuggingActive(context)` queries the system global setting `adb_wifi_enabled` first. If enabled, it returns `true`; otherwise, it falls back to reading the system property `service.adb.tls.port` via `readAdbTlsConnectPort(context)`, the screen-scanned cache, and local Network Service Discovery (mDNS) port lookup to check if Wireless Debugging is active (port > 0).

The results are presented to the user as clear, localized guidance messages in the settings card:
- **Running:** "Privileged Mode is active and running."
- **No Credentials:** "No pairing credentials found. Please run the setup wizard to pair this device."
- **Wireless Debugging Disabled:** "Wireless Debugging is inactive. Please enable Wireless Debugging in Developer Options."
- **Wireless Debugging Active, Disconnected:** "Wireless Debugging is active. Tap Connect to start Privileged Mode."
- **Connecting:** "Connecting to daemon..."

This dialog uses the same wording and colors as the settings status messages. It has three actions:
1. **Connect:** Triggers a background retry connect sequence.
2. **Skip:** Dismisses the dialog for this app run session.
3. **Developer Settings:** A shortcut button that opens the system's Developer Options / Wireless Debugging screen on the main display. This button is only shown when Wireless Debugging is inactive (`isWirelessDebuggingActive == false`).

Opening the Global Settings screen also automatically suppresses/skips the dialog to avoid overlapping layouts.

- **Unsupported Language Fallback**: When `AutoSetupLanguageConfig.fromLocaleOrNull(systemLocale)` returns `null` (unsupported system language), `PrivilegedStepContent` replaces the automated checklist card and "Auto Setup" button with a **Manual Setup Steps Card** formatted in `colors.surfaceVariant` with rounded corners and border. The description text displays a warning message in `colors.error` notifying the user that their system language is not yet supported for auto-setup and asking them to request support.

### Security Model

Privileged Mode crosses the app sandbox boundary by delegating selected kernel I/O to `megingiard_privd`, a shell-UID helper started through ADB Wireless Debugging. The socket is therefore treated as a privileged command channel: every connection must authenticate before feature commands are accepted.

#### Per-install Key Scheme

The authentication key is **never embedded in the APK**. Instead:

1. During bootstrap the app generates 32 random bytes with `SecureRandom`.
2. The key is encrypted under an AES-256-GCM Keystore key (`megingiard_privd_pair_key_v1`, hardware-backed where available) and stored in `noBackupFilesDir/privd_pair_key.enc`. Backup is explicitly excluded so the key never leaves the device.
3. The plaintext key is transmitted to the daemon over the already-authenticated ADB TLS channel: `megingiard_privd [--keyfile <path>] [--port <port>] --provision <key_hex> <app_uid>`.
4. The daemon writes it to the designated state keyfile, e.g. `/data/local/tmp/megingiard_privd.key` for release or `/data/local/tmp/megingiard_privd_debug.key` for debug (mode 0600, shell-owned) together with the provisioned app UID.
5. On every subsequent app start `PrivdPairKey.load()` decrypts the key from Keystore storage and `PrivdClient.loadKey()` places it in memory.

Android destroys the Keystore AES key when the app is uninstalled, making the stored ciphertext permanently unreadable. A reinstalled app therefore cannot silently inherit the old daemon's trust relationship — re-bootstrap is required.

#### OS-Level Peer Credential Checks (Deprecated)

OS-level peer credential checks (`SO_PEERCRED` / `peerCredentials.uid` checks) are not used because communication runs over a local TCP loopback (`127.0.0.1`) which does not support peer credentials. The system relies entirely on the cryptographic mutual HMAC-SHA256 handshake described below to authenticate both the client app and the daemon.

#### Mutual HMAC-SHA256 Handshake & Protocol Version Verification

Every new TCP socket connection uses mutual challenge-response followed by protocol version verification. Both sides must know the per-install key and agree on the daemon protocol version (`PRIVD_VERSION`):

```
Daemon -> App     CHAL <32-hex-nonce1>\n
App    -> Daemon  AUTH <64-hex-hmac1>\n    HMAC-SHA256(key, nonce1)
Daemon -> App     OK\n
App    -> Daemon  VERIFY <32-hex-nonce2>\n
Daemon -> App     PROOF <64-hex-hmac2>\n   HMAC-SHA256(key, nonce2)
App    -> Daemon  VERSION <app_version>\n  Protocol version check
Daemon -> App     VERSION_OK <daemon_ver>\n Version match confirmed
```

The first half (`CHAL/AUTH/OK`) proves the app knows the key before the daemon accepts commands. The second half (`VERIFY/PROOF`) proves the daemon knows the key before the app sends privileged commands. The third phase (`VERSION/VERSION_OK`) validates daemon protocol compatibility:

- **Version Matching**: The app sends `VERSION <app_version>\n`. If `<app_version> == daemon_version`, the daemon responds with `VERSION_OK <daemon_ver>\n`.
- **Version Mismatch Handling**: If `<app_version> != daemon_version`, the daemon responds with `VERSION_MISMATCH <daemon_ver>\n` and closes the socket.
- **Legacy Daemon / Legacy App Handling**:
  - Legacy pre-versioning daemons ignore `VERSION` and produce no `VERSION_OK` response; the app's 1-second version read times out and treats the connection as failed.
  - Legacy pre-versioning apps fail to issue `VERSION` as their initial command; new daemons reject unverified initial commands with `VERSION_MISMATCH` and close the socket.
- **Auto-Update & Reconnect Prompt**: Connection failure triggers background auto-rebootstrap (or `PrivdState.FAILED` with `PrivdError.VERSION_MISMATCH`), guiding daemon replacement during app upgrades or downgrades.
- **Mandatory Version Increment Rule**: Whenever the daemon source code (`megingiard_privd.c`) or protocol behavior is updated, developers and agents **must** increment `PRIVD_VERSION` in both `megingiard_privd.c` and `PrivdConstants.kt` and run `./scripts/build_megingiard_privd.sh`.

Malformed messages, missing messages, wrong HMAC values, version mismatch, or timeout expiration fail closed and close the socket. The handshake read timeout is 5 seconds for HMAC and 1 second for version check, and is reset to normal blocking I/O only after the full exchange succeeds.

The daemon compares the app's `AUTH` proof with a constant-time XOR accumulator. The Kotlin app compares the daemon `PROOF` through `HmacUtil.constantTimeEqualsHex()` so both authentication legs avoid early-exit string equality for same-length MAC values.

#### Native Asset Verification & Pre-Push Cleanup During Bootstrap

`PrivdBootstrapper` kills any running daemon process (`kill -9`) and deletes `/data/local/tmp/megingiard_privd` over ADB shell prior to pushing fresh binaries to clear `ETXTBSY` file locks from active daemon instances. It verifies the SHA-256 pin of `megingiard_privd_arm64` before pushing it over ADB `sync:`. It also verifies `megingiard_mirror.dex` before pushing the privileged mirror server asset. A daemon verification failure aborts bootstrap; a mirror DEX verification failure is logged and leaves the normal MediaProjection fallback path available.

Upon daemon replacement and reconnection, active subsystems automatically recover:
- **Screen Mirroring (`ScreenCaptureService`):** Observes `PrivdClient.state` and automatically starts a new `DirectPrivdMirrorSession` on the new daemon, restoring mirror output without user intervention.
- **Input Injectors (`KeyInjector`, `TouchInjector`, `MouseInjector`, `GamepadInjector`):** `InjectorBackendRouter` automatically re-synchronizes backend routing and re-sends initialization commands (`KB_START` for keyboard) to establish input nodes on the new daemon.

Detailed native rebuild and generated hash behavior are documented in [BUILD_NATIVE.md](../../BUILD_NATIVE.md#native-asset-integrity).

#### Operational Notes

- The HMAC key is provisioned automatically during the Privileged Mode setup wizard. No manual key management is required.
- Re-running the setup wizard generates a fresh key, replaces the daemon binary, and re-provisions the daemon.
- Key rotation and signing-certificate rotation are manual re-bootstrap / redeploy operations today.

### Wire Protocol

ASCII, newline-terminated, both directions. Each feature uses a two-letter
command prefix; new feature modules can claim new prefixes without breaking
the existing protocol.

For the privileged mirror (`MIRROR START_DIRECT`), the `app_process` child registers the Binder service `megingiard.direct.surface` to receive multiple target `Surface` instances and their physical dimensions. This allows the direct mirror server to set up and capture multiple concurrent virtual displays mapping to different cutout regions without process restarts.

`SUB GAMEPAD` and `SUB TOUCH` open the physical evdev nodes (`/dev/input/event*` for gamepad, `/dev/input/event6` for touchscreen) read-only/read-write and start dedicated reader threads that forward filtered `EVT` and `EVT_TOUCH` lines to the app. The fds are **not** grabbed via `EVIOCGRAB` — evdev is multicast, so Android's EventHub continues to dispatch the same events to the foreground game in parallel. Recording is therefore purely passive observation; nothing is intercepted or replayed.

On startup the daemon prints exactly one line on **stdout** so the
spawn command can detect success:

| Line  | Meaning                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `R\n` | Listening socket bound + physical gamepad node opened — ready |
| `N\n` | No suitable gamepad found, daemon exits 1                     |
| `E\n` | Generic startup failure (e.g. socket bind), daemon exits 1    |

> **Note:** The bootstrapper spawns the daemon process in the foreground and reads its stdout stream directly. The daemon prints `R\n`, `N\n`, or `E\n` and forks inside `detach_from_shell()`. The parent process exits immediately (which cleanly closes the stdout pipe and terminates the shell), while the child daemon starts a new session (`setsid()`), ignores `SIGHUP`, and redirects standard streams to `/dev/null`. This fork-detach sequence guarantees that SIGHUP immunity is fully established before the shell channel is closed, preventing any race conditions. The bootstrapper decodes this token to verify daemon readiness or immediately fail with a descriptive error.

### State Machine

```
       [user taps Connect]
OFF ──────────────────────▶ CONNECTING ─── socket accept ✓ ──▶ RUNNING
 ▲                              │
 │                              └── socket refused ──▶ FAILED
 │
 │   [wizard: pair → push → spawn → verify]
 OFF ──────────────────────▶ BOOTSTRAPPING ── verify ✓ ──▶ RUNNING
                                  │
                                  └── any stage failed ──▶ FAILED
```

During the VERIFYING phase of bootstrap, `PrivdBootstrapper` calls
`PrivdManager.verifyConnect()` (not the public `connect()`) for each retry.
`verifyConnect()` attempts `PrivdClient.connect()` without publishing
`CONNECTING` or `FAILED` state transitions, so the UI stays in `BOOTSTRAPPING`
throughout all retries. Only on success does state advance to `RUNNING`;
if all retries are exhausted, `reportBootstrapFailure(DAEMON_UNREACHABLE)`
explicitly sets `FAILED`.

`PrivdClient.isConnected` is the source of truth for the running status.
`PrivdManager.state` is the user-visible projection. The `BOOTSTRAPPING`
state covers the entire wizard flow; the finer-grained `BootstrapStage`
enum (IDLE / PAIRING / CONNECTING_ADB / PUSHING_BINARY / SPAWNING_DAEMON /
VERIFYING / DONE) is exposed by `PrivdBootstrapper.stage` for the wizard
UI.

### Threading

`PrivdClient` owns two background threads after `connect()`:

1. **Writer** — drains a `LinkedBlockingQueue<String>` of ASCII commands
   into the LocalSocket output stream.
2. **Reader** — continuously reads `\n`-terminated daemon responses;
   completes the pending `pingDeferred` on `PONG`.

Both threads exit when the socket fails, calling `markBroken()` which
flips `running = false`, updates `_state` to `DISCONNECTED`, and schedules
a full `disconnect()` on a daemon thread to close the socket fd and
unblock the writer thread safely without risk of deadlock.

`PrivdManager` launches a coroutine on its own `CoroutineScope` (backed by
`SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default`) that collects `PrivdClient.state`.
When the state drops to `DISCONNECTED` while `PrivdManager.state == RUNNING`,
the manager automatically transitions to `FAILED` with
`PrivdError.DAEMON_UNREACHABLE`, keeping the UI in sync with the real transport
state even after an unexpected drop.

`GlobalSettingsViewModel.privdConnect()` dispatches to `Dispatchers.IO` via
`viewModelScope` so the blocking `LocalSocket.connect()` never runs on the
main thread.

The `BOOTSTRAPPING` state covers the entire wizard flow; the finer-grained `BootstrapStage`
enum (IDLE / PAIRING / CONNECTING_ADB / PUSHING_BINARY / SPAWNING_DAEMON /
VERIFYING / DONE) is exposed by `PrivdBootstrapper.stage` for the wizard UI.
Key provisioning happens during the `PUSHING_BINARY` stage (after a successful binary push
but before spawning the daemon) — no separate `PROVISIONING` stage is needed.

### Strategy Routing in GamepadInjector

`GamepadInjector` is a strategy router. At `start()` time it decides:

```
if (PrivdClient.isConnected) {
    backend = PrivdGamepadInjector  // physical-pad merge
} else {
    backend = ShellGamepadInjector  // standard virtual uinput
}
```

The chosen backend is locked in for the session — toggling the setting
mid-game requires a leave-and-re-enter of the MacroPad mode.
