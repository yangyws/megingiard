/**
 * Singleton that coordinates the touch recording flow (taps and gestures) for macro steps.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. [requestRecording] — called from the timeline editor when the user taps "Record Touch"
 *    and selects a mode. Sets [recordingRequested] to `true`, which [ScreenCaptureService]
 *    observes to show [RecordingMirrorPresentation] on the secondary display.
 * 2. [onTapRecorded] — called by [RecordingMirrorPresentation] for TAP mode and keeps
 *    the legacy one-shot flow.
 * 3. [recordGestureCompleted] — called for each completed GESTURE segment. The
 *    presentation stays open until [finishRecording] or [cancelRecording].
 * 4. The timeline editor observes [recordedTap] or [state] and appends the
 *    corresponding step(s), then calls [consumeRecordedTap] / [resetState].
