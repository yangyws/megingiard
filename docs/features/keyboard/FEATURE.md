## Functional Requirements

### Overview

The Virtual Keyboard feature turns the secondary display into a full hardware keyboard, allowing the user to type text and trigger key shortcuts on the primary screen without touching the primary display. It supports multiple regional layouts and an integrated trackpoint for cursor control.

### FR-K1: Virtual Keyboard Layout

- The secondary display MUST show a **virtual keyboard (inspired by Gboard)** anchored to the bottom.
- The layout MUST support **QWERTZ**, **QWERTY**, and **AZERTY** regional variants, selectable via Settings or the keyboard's globe key.
- The keyboard MUST feature a **4-row key layout** consisting of letter rows and a bottom spacebar bar, alongside two horizontal toolbars (top toolbar above the keys, and bottom toolbar below the keys).
- The keyboard MUST support dynamic layout sub-modes:
  - **LETTERS:** standard alphabetic keys, with superscript digits (1–0) visible on the top row.
  - **SYMBOLS 1:** numbers and common symbols layout, accessed via the `?123` switcher key.
  - **SYMBOLS 2:** alternate math/currency symbols layout, accessed via the `=\<` switcher key.
- Tapping switcher keys toggles the active sub-mode locally in the UI, while the globe key cycles regional layouts.
- Shift and AltGr alternate labels MUST be shown on individual keys when the respective modifier is active.

### FR-K2: Modifier Keys

- On the ergo keyboard top toolbar, **Esc**, **Tab**, **Ctrl**, and **Alt** buttons MUST be displayed on the left side as rounded text buttons surrounded by a thin white border (AltGr is only displayed on the compact full keyboard layout), while **Shift** is placed within the standard letter grid.
- **Ctrl**, **Alt**, **AltGr**, **Shift**, and **Meta** MUST support a **three-state lifecycle**:
  - **INACTIVE:** default; modifier is not applied.
  - **STICKY:** activated by a short tap; the modifier is applied to the **next non-modifier key injection only**, then resets to INACTIVE.
  - **HELD:** activated by holding the modifier key for ≥ 300 ms; the modifier remains active until the finger is lifted from the key.
- Any non-modifier key injection while a modifier is STICKY MUST automatically release all STICKY modifiers after the key is injected.

### FR-K3: Integrated Trackpoint — Mouse Mode

- When enabled in Settings, the keyboard MUST render a **trackpoint key** (accent-colored dot `●`) in the home row.
- Touching the trackpoint and moving the finger MUST translate relative delta movements into mouse cursor movement on the primary display via `MouseInjector` from the shared `input/` package.
- Movement sensitivity is configurable and controlled by a multiplier applied to the raw Compose delta values.

### FR-K6: Virtual Mouse Button Overlay

- While the trackpoint is actively touched, the keyboard MUST show a semi-transparent **mouse button overlay** alongside the trackpoint area.
- The overlay MUST contain the following buttons:
  - **LMB** (left mouse button, 1×2 pill)
  - **MMB** (middle mouse button, 1×1 circle)
  - **RMB** (right mouse button, 1×2 pill)
  - **M4** / **M5** (extra mouse buttons 4 and 5, 1×1 circles) above and below the scroll wheel
  - **Scroll Wheel** (1×2 pill, vertical drag accumulates and sends scroll events)
- The overlay MUST disappear as soon as the user lifts all fingers from the trackpoint.
- The horizontal placement of the button column (left edge, right edge, or both) MUST be configurable via a **Button Position** setting.
- When placed on the **right** side, the layout is mirrored so LMB/MMB/RMB remain at the outer edge and the scroll column (M4/ScrollWheel/M5) is inward.
- Button events MUST be consumed at `PointerEventPass.Initial` so they do not accidentally close the overlay.

### FR-K4: Key Repeat & Long-Press Character Popup

- When **Key Repeat** is enabled in Settings, holding the backspace key (`"bksp"`) MUST trigger the initial key injection after **500 ms**, followed by repeated injections every **30 ms**.
- Holding a top-row character key (which displays a superscript number) instead triggers a popup options bubble showing its numeric alternative after **400 ms** (no letter variants or umlauts are displayed).
- Standard character keys do not support repeated key inputs upon press/hold; instead, their single key injection is deferred to finger release to prevent conflicts with the long-press overlay.
- Dragging horizontally on the popup overlay selects the alternative number/symbol. Releasing the finger injects the selected option and dismisses the popup.
- On the compact full keyboard layout, long-pressing keys does not show secondary popup options; instead only the preview popup shows, and moving the finger performs slide-to-correct.
- When Key Repeat is **disabled** for control keys, a key-up event MUST be sent immediately at the moment of the initial key-down to prevent the system-level repeat from firing.

### FR-K5: No Special Permissions Required

- The keyboard MUST function without root access or additional Android permissions beyond the app's declared set.
- On the AYN Thor, the `/dev/uinput` device node is accessible under the standard shell UID (2000).

### FR-K7: Quick Keyboard Bar

- A slim rounded bar tab (QuickKeyboardBar) MUST be rendered at the left/start side of the configured screen edge, matching the styling and behavior of the Quick Menu Bar.
- Swiping this bar from the edge MUST open the virtual keyboard overlay with a slide-in + fade animation:
  - From the bottom up if the Quick Menu is configured at the bottom.
  - From the top down if the Quick Menu is configured at the top.
- While the keyboard is active, the QuickKeyboardBar MUST be hidden. Swiping from the edge closes the keyboard overlay.

### FR-K8: Spacebar Cursor Navigation

- Pressing and holding the spacebar key (`"space"` or `"space_num"`) and dragging horizontally MUST trigger cursor navigation.
- If the drag distance exceeds **12 dp**, cursor sliding mode is activated. The visual key press is cancelled and no space character will be typed on finger release.
- Moving the finger horizontally during cursor sliding mode by every **10 dp** MUST inject a single `KEY_LEFT` (for leftward swipe) or `KEY_RIGHT` (for rightward swipe) keypress.
- If the finger is released without triggering the drag threshold, a single space character event MUST be injected on up release.

### FR-K9: Keyboard Settings Toolbar Button & Screen

- The bottom toolbar MUST render a Settings Cog button on the right-hand side.
- Tapping this button MUST open a fullscreen Keyboard Settings screen overlay.
- The settings screen MUST include a dropdown to select between **QWERTZ**, **QWERTY**, and **AZERTY** regional layouts.
- Switching layout via this dropdown MUST only impact the alphabetic (`LETTERS` / ABC) keyboard layout, leaving symbol and numeric layouts unaffected.

### FR-K10: Keyboard-Top Touchpad

- When enabled in Settings, the keyboard screen MUST show a relative touchpad in the area above the keyboard layout.
- The touchpad MUST support relative cursor movement and gesture clicks/taps (tap-to-click, two-finger-tap, three-finger-tap, tap-drag, and two-finger scrolling) by reusing `TouchpadGestureProcessor` and piping mouse events to `MouseInjector`.
- The touchpad MUST not feature physical click buttons.
- Sensitivity (pointer speed) and scroll speed settings MUST be inherited from the general Touchpad Settings configurations.

### FR-K11: Compact Full Keyboard Mode

- The virtual keyboard MUST support a toggleable **Compact Full Keyboard Mode** displaying all standard physical keys (including F1-F12, Esc, Tab, Meta, and dedicated Arrow keys) in a single 6-row grid.
- The mode MUST be toggled via a dedicated keyboard layout toggle button in the bottom toolbar.
- The virtual keyboard height MUST adapt smoothly when transitioning:
  - The keyboard container height MUST animate smoothly from `262 dp` to `270 dp` (or vice versa) using a transition animation.
  - The keyboard grid height MUST adapt from `168 dp` to `220 dp`.
- The transition between different layout modes (standard, ergo, compact full) MUST use a visual crossfade animation with isolated layout subtrees, preventing any scrambling or button recycling visual artifacts.
- The layout MUST align columns precisely by using uniform row width weights of `15.0f` per row.
- Special character keys in Compact Full Keyboard Mode MUST show both their unshifted and shifted symbols simultaneously, stacked vertically on the key cap. The currently active symbol (determined by the state of the Shift/CapsLock modifiers) is highlighted, and the inactive symbol is dimmed.
- Holding a character key in Compact Full Keyboard Mode MUST NOT trigger any secondary options popup; only its standard character preview popup is displayed.
- Moving the finger while holding down a character key in Compact Full Keyboard Mode MUST perform slide-to-correct: it dynamically updates the hovered key and its corresponding preview popup. The final character is injected upon finger release.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Compose UI (KeyboardScreen)
      │  key events (DOWN/UP + active modifier keycodes)
      ▼
KeyboardState         ← modifier state machine (one StateFlow<ModifierState> per modifier key)
      │  activeModifierKeycodes()
      ▼
KeyInjector           ← public facade: start(), stop(), keyDown(keycode), keyUp(keycode)
      │  KD / KU commands via stdin
      ▼
ShellKeyInjector      ← native binary lifecycle + LinkedBlockingQueue writer thread
      │  stdin pipe
      ▼
keyinjector_arm64     ← native process
      │  ioctl / write()
      ▼
/dev/uinput           ← Linux virtual input device
```

Trackpoint movement is delegated to `MouseInjector` from the shared `input/` package, which drives `ShellMouseInjector` → `mouseinjector_arm64` for relative cursor movement. The virtual mouse button overlay (LMB / MMB / RMB / M4 / M5 / scroll wheel) also calls `MouseInjector` directly.

### Native Binary: Deployment & Lifecycle

The pre-built `keyinjector_arm64` binary is bundled in `companion/ui/src/main/assets/`. On `ShellKeyInjector.start()`:

1. Copy binary from `assets/` to `context.filesDir` (app-private directory).
2. Call `setExecutable(true)` — the files directory has the execute bit disabled by default.
3. Launch via `ProcessBuilder(binary.absolutePath)`.

The binary signals readiness by writing `"R\n"` to stdout. `start()` blocks waiting for this signal with a 5-second timeout; startup fails if the signal does not arrive or the process exits prematurely.

The binary opens `/dev/uinput` using the standard `uinput` protocol (register a virtual keyboard device, then inject `EV_KEY` events). Injector start and stop lifecycle is centrally managed by `InjectorLifecycleManager`, which evaluates app UI state (`AppStateManager.uiMode`), active MacroPad layout keyboard controls, and blocking modals to determine when `KeyInjector` should be active:

* **ON**: When `UiMode.FULLSCREEN_KEYBOARD` is active, or when an active MacroPad layout has keyboard buttons and no blocking editor/modal is open.
* **OFF**: When no keyboard controls are needed, or when any editor modal, settings screen, quick menu, or prompt is active (ensuring Android's standard soft IME operates without hardware keyboard conflicts).

```kotlin
InjectorLifecycleManager.watch(context)
```

### Stdin Protocol

Commands are sent as newline-terminated ASCII strings to the binary's stdin:

| Command  | Format           | Description                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| KEY DOWN | `KD <keycode>\n` | Press key with Linux keycode   |
| KEY UP   | `KU <keycode>\n` | Release key with Linux keycode |

`<keycode>` is an integer from `LinuxKeycodes.kt`, which maps directly to the constants in Linux `input-event-codes.h` (e.g. `KEY_A = 30`, `KEY_LEFTSHIFT = 42`).

### Writer Thread

`ShellKeyInjector` maintains a `LinkedBlockingQueue<KeyCommand>` drained by a dedicated daemon thread:

```
loop:
  command = queue.take()    // blocks until an event is available
  write command to binary stdin
```

Unlike the touch injection writer thread, **no coalescing is applied** — every key-down and key-up must be delivered in order. Dropping intermediate events would result in stuck keys or missing characters.

### Layout System

`KeyboardLayout.kt` defines all layouts using the `KeyDef` data class:

```kotlin
data class KeyDef(
    val id: String,           // unique key identifier (e.g. "lshift", "key_a")
    val label: String,        // primary label shown on the key
    val linuxKeycode: Int,    // Linux input-event-codes constant
    val widthWeight: Float,   // relative key width (1.0 = standard key)
    val type: KeyType,        // NORMAL | MODIFIER | TRACKPOINT
    val shiftLabel: String?,  // label shown when Shift is STICKY or HELD
    val altGrLabel: String?,  // label shown when AltGr is STICKY or HELD
)
```

Layouts share a common **function row** (F1–F12) and **bottom bar** (Ctrl / Meta / Alt / Space / AltGr / arrow keys). Only the letter rows and number row differ between QWERTZ, QWERTY, and AZERTY.

### Modifier State Machine

`KeyboardState` maintains one `StateFlow<ModifierState>` per modifier key ID:

| State      | Triggered by                        | Released by                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `INACTIVE` | Default; after STICKY auto-release  | —                              |
| `STICKY`   | Quick tap (< 300 ms press duration) | Any non-modifier key injection |
| `HELD`     | Long press (≥ 300 ms)               | Finger lifted from modifier    |

#### CapsLock Toggle (via Shift Button)
- Long pressing the Shift button (`"lshift"` / `"rshift"`) for `≥ 300 ms` activates CapsLock (`caps` state set to `HELD`). Lift-release leaves CapsLock active so subsequent characters remain capitalized.
- Tapping the Shift button once (quick press/release) while CapsLock is active turns off both Shift and CapsLock, returning the keyboard to lowercase input.
- **Letter Constraints**: Shift/CapsLock modifiers only apply to alphabetical letter keys. Non-letter keys (numbers, symbols, spaces, backspaces) do not receive the Shift modifier keycode unless a Shift key is physically held down.
- **Layout Switch Reset**: Both CapsLock and Shift states are immediately reset to `INACTIVE` when switching keyboard layout or mode.

`KeyboardState.activeModifierKeycodes()` collects the Linux keycodes of all modifiers that are currently STICKY or HELD. These are injected as key-down events before the primary key and key-up events after it.

`KeyboardState.releaseStickyModifiers()` is called after each non-modifier key injection to transition all STICKY states back to INACTIVE.

### Key Repeat

When Key Repeat is **enabled** (default: on):

```
onPress:       enqueue DOWN; start 500 ms repeat timer
onRepeatTimer: enqueue DOWN every 30 ms while key is held
onRelease:     cancel timer; enqueue UP
```

When Key Repeat is **disabled**:

```
onPress: enqueue DOWN immediately followed by UP
         → key is consumed in a single frame; kernel repeat never triggers
```

### Trackpoint

The trackpoint key renders as an accent-colored `●` in the home row. When the user touches and moves the trackpoint:

1. Delta movement (in Compose pixels) is scaled by a sensitivity factor (`KB_TRACKPOINT_MOUSE_SENSITIVITY`).
2. The relative pixel change is passed directly to `MouseInjector.moveMouse(dx, dy)`.
3. `MouseInjector` forwards the relative move command (`MM <dx> <dy>`) to the native `mouseinjector_arm64` binary which controls the relative cursor on the primary screen.

### Overlay Blocking

When a full-screen UI overlay is visible:

- New **Press** and **Move** events on keyboard keys are blocked so overlay gestures and menu actions take precedence.
- **Release** events always pass through so that any key already in-flight receives a proper UP injection and does not get stuck.

### Settings

| Fullscreen Mode    | `kb_fullscreen`         | `false`  | Expand keyboard to use full screen area                   |
| Button Position    | `kb_mouse_btn_pos`      | `LEFT`   | Mouse button overlay placement (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `BOTH`) |
| Keyboard Touchpad  | `kb_touchpad_enabled`   | `true`   | Show touchpad on top of the keyboard layout              |

### Secondary Display Rendering (Background Display Mode)

When screen mirroring is active (`ScreenCaptureManager.isCapturing == true`), `KeyboardScreen` is composed inside `MirrorPresentation` as **Layer 5** — above `BackgroundMacroPadOverlay` — so it appears on the secondary display.

`MainAppScreen` suppresses the `KeyboardScreen` instance on the primary display whenever screen mirroring is active, ensuring only one instance of `KeyInjector` runs at a time.

Both screens feature a left-aligned visual `QuickKeyboardBarTab` and use a dedicated `SwipeGestureProcessor` covering the left-most 120 dp edge zone (representing the `QuickKeyboardBar`) to swipe and toggle the virtual keyboard overlay. 

When toggled, `KeyboardScreen` is shown/hidden via `AnimatedVisibility` with a slide-in + fade transition:
- Animates from the bottom up when `SettingsManager.overlayAtBottom` is true.
- Animates from the top down when `SettingsManager.overlayAtBottom` is false.

Dismissal on both displays reuses the edge-swipe gesture path: swiping any edge bar zone (center or left) while the keyboard is open resolves to `AppStateManager.closeActiveModal()`, closing the overlay with a matching slide-out and fade-out animation.
