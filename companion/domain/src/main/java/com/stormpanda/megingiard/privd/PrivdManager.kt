/**
 * Features that become available when Privileged Mode is connected.
 * Each entry has its own user-controllable enable flag (see
 * [com.stormpanda.megingiard.settings.MacroPadSettings]).
 *
 * To add a new feature:
 *   1. Add an enum value here.
 *   2. Add a per-feature DataStore key in `SettingsKeys.kt`.
 *   3. Expose a `StateFlow<Boolean>` + setter on [com.stormpanda.megingiard.settings.MacroPadSettings].
 *   4. Wire the consumer to check both [PrivdManager.state] == RUNNING **and** the per-feature flag.
