## Functional Requirements

### Overview

The Configuration Export / Import feature lets users save the complete application state — all
tool settings and MacroPad profiles / macros — to a portable `.mgrd` file, and restore it on
the same device or share individual profiles with other Megingiard users.

### FR-CF1: Full App Backup Export

- The user MUST be able to export all app settings (Global, Mirror, Touchpad, Keyboard) and all
  MacroPad profiles (each containing its own macros) to a single `.mgrd` backup file.
- The export file MUST be created via the Android Storage Access Framework (SAF) so the user
  controls the destination folder.
- The user MAY optionally provide author, description, and comma-separated tags before exporting
  (community metadata).
- The suggested default filename MUST include the application version name (prefixed with "v"), the current date, and, if provided, the author
  (up to 20 chars) and description (up to 30 chars) to help users identify files.
  Format: `megingiard_v<versionName>_<date>[_<author>][_<description>].mgrd`.
- The export MUST embed an SHA-256 checksum to detect file corruption or unintended modification.
  This is a data-integrity check, distinct from the application / daemon hardening layers
  summarized in [SECURITY_CONCEPT.md](../../../SECURITY_CONCEPT.md).
- An animated toast notification ("Configuration exported successfully") MUST be shown after the backup is saved without interrupting the user with a modal dialog.

### FR-CF2: Backup Restore (Import)

- The user MUST be able to restore a backup `.mgrd` file from Global Settings via a system file
  picker that shows all files (`*/*` filter — the custom MIME type is not registered in the Android
  MIME database, so filtering by MIME type would produce an empty list).
- The app MUST also respond to `ACTION_VIEW` intents with MIME type
  `application/vnd.megingiard.config+json`, so files can be opened from any file manager or
  sharing app.
- On import the user MUST be shown a preview of the file's metadata and which sections it contains
  before any changes are applied.
- If the imported file's checksum does not match its contents, the import MUST be rejected with an
  error message.

### FR-CF3: Conflict-Free Side-by-Side Import

- Imported MacroPad profiles (with embedded macros) MUST be added alongside existing items
  with new UUIDs — never merging or overwriting existing data.
- Imported profiles and macros retain their original names.
- For **backup restore** imports: tool settings (Global, Mirror, Touchpad, Keyboard) present in
  the file ARE applied directly, overwriting current values.
- For **profile-share** imports: settings in the file are always ignored.

### FR-CF4: Schema Versioning

- Every `.mgrd` file MUST carry a `schemaVersion` field (integer, currently `4`).
- The app MUST accept imports with `schemaVersion` 3 or 4. Older versions are rejected.
- Files with an unsupported `schemaVersion` (below 3 or above 4) MUST be rejected with an error.

### FR-CF5: Delete All Custom Profiles (Restore Defaults)

- The user MUST be able to reset MacroPad profiles from the **Share & Backup** section in Global Settings using the **"Delete all custom profiles"** action.
- This operation deletes all existing profiles and creates a single blank "Default" profile.
- Instead of showing a popup confirmation dialog, tapping the action card triggers a 5-second countdown timer directly inside the badge ("5s" → "1s"). Once elapsed, the badge transitions to "Confirm", requiring an explicit secondary tap to execute profile deletion.

### FR-CF6: Per-Profile Share Export

- The user MUST be able to export a single MacroPad profile as a `.mgrd` file for sharing with
  other users.
- The user MUST be able to select which profile to export when more than one profile exists.
- The export file MUST contain an empty `settings` map — app settings are never included in
  a profile-share export, so importing it cannot overwrite another user's app preferences.
- The user MAY optionally provide author, description, and comma-separated tags before exporting.
- The suggested filename format is:
  `megingiard_profile_v<versionName>_<date>[_<profileName up to 30 chars>][_<author up to 20 chars>].mgrd`.
- An animated toast notification ("Profile exported successfully") MUST be shown after the profile export is saved without interrupting the user with a modal dialog.

### FR-CF7: Per-Profile Share Import

- The user MUST be able to import a shared profile `.mgrd` file from Global Settings.
- The import preview dialog MUST indicate that settings in the file will be ignored.
- After a successful profile-share import, only the profiles are added (via
  `ConfigManager.applyProfileImport()`); `SettingsManager` is NOT updated.
- An animated toast notification ("Profile imported successfully") MUST be shown after the profile is imported without interrupting the user with a modal dialog.

### FR-CF8: Automatic Daily Backups

- On application startup, once the configuration succeeds in loading, the system MUST check whether an internal configuration backup has been made for the current calendar day (in local time).
- If no backup exists for the current day, a full backup (including all settings and MacroPad profiles) MUST be automatically captured and saved in the DataStore under `KEY_INTERNAL_BACKUPS`.
- Backups MUST be retained for the last 5 individual days the app was used on. When a 6th day is added, the oldest backup is automatically pruned to keep exactly 5 days of history.

### FR-CF9: Enhanced Restore Sub-Menu & In-Deck Review

- When invoking the "Restore Backup" function under Global Settings, a dedicated sub-menu within the two-pane scaffold (`RestoreBackupSubPage`) MUST be displayed.
- The first option in the selection list MUST be "External File", which routes the user to the standard SAF file picker upon selection.
- Subsequent options in the list MUST show the 5 internal daily backups, labelled by their localized creation weekday, date, and time (e.g. `Sunday, 2026-05-24 21:15`), and showing the count of profiles, layouts, and macros.
- Selecting an internal daily backup or an external file MUST transition the right-pane deck into a dedicated in-deck **Review & Apply** view showing archive metadata, contents breakdown, overwrite notice, and an "Apply & Restore" gamepad action card without showing floating popup modals. Pressing back smoothly returns to the backup selection list. Upon confirming the restore, an animated toast notification ("Backup restored successfully") MUST be shown.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

```
GlobalSettingsScreen (Compose UI, 2-Pane Console Navigation)
        │
        │  user taps Export / Import / Share Profile / Import Shared Profile
        ▼
ConfigManager  ← StateFlow bridge (GlobalSettingsScreen has no direct ActivityResultRegistryOwner
        │         when rendered inside PrimaryOverlayActivity)
        │
        │  exportRequest: SharedFlow<ExportKind>   (Backup | ProfileShare)
        │  importRequest: SharedFlow<ImportMode>   (BACKUP_RESTORE | PROFILE_SHARE)
        │  pendingInAppImportMode: StateFlow<ImportMode>
        ▼
MainActivity  ← holds ActivityResultLaunchers
        │  createDocumentLauncher (export) / openDocumentLauncher (*/* — all files, import)
        │
        ├── Export path (Backup):
        │       ConfigManager.buildExport() → ConfigManager.writeToUri()
        │       → ConfigManager.setExportResult()
        │
        ├── Export path (ProfileShare):
        │       ConfigManager.buildProfileExport() → ConfigManager.writeToUri()
        │       → ConfigManager.setExportResult()
        │
        └── Import path:
                ConfigManager.setPendingInAppUri(uri, mode)
                        │
                        ▼
                MainAppScreen.LaunchedEffect(pendingImportUri)
                        │  suspend – Dispatchers.IO
                        ▼
                ConfigManager.readFromUri()  →  ConfigManager.setParsedImport()
                        │
                        ▼
                GlobalSettingsScreen RestoreBackupSubPage (In-Deck Review & Apply)
                        ├── BACKUP_RESTORE → ConfigManager.applyImport()
                        └── PROFILE_SHARE  → ConfigManager.applyProfileImport()
```

For external file intents (`ACTION_VIEW`):

```
File manager / share sheet
        │  Intent(ACTION_VIEW, uri, mimeType=application/vnd.megingiard.config+json)
        ▼
MainActivity.onNewIntent() / onCreate()
        │
        ▼
ConfigManager.setPendingUri(uri)   ← StateFlow bridge
        │
        ▼
MainAppScreen.LaunchedEffect(pendingImportUri)
        │  suspend – Dispatchers.IO
        ▼
ConfigManager.readFromUri()  →  ConfigManager.setParsedImport(export)
        │
        ▼
IncomingImportDialog  ─── user confirms → ConfigManager.applyImport()
```

### File Format — `.mgrd`

`.mgrd` files are UTF-8 JSON with the schema defined in `ConfigSchema.kt`:

> [!NOTE]
> Custom background image binaries (stored locally in `filesDir/backgrounds/`) can be optionally bundled within `.mgrd` ZIP container files when exporting (controlled by an "Include background images" checkbox, checked by default, in the export metadata dialogs). When enabled, image files are archived alongside `config.json` and automatically unpacked to `filesDir/backgrounds/bg_<newLayoutId>` with remapped UUIDs on import. Daily internal backups stored locally in DataStore exclude background images to conserve disk space. For plain JSON `.mgrd` files (or when images are excluded), layout `backgroundImagePath` references are safely handled with fallback to a solid black background.

**Schema v4 (current):**

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 4,
  "metadata": {
    "appVersionCode": 12,
    "appVersionName": "1.2.0",
    "exportedAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "deviceModel": "AYN Thor",
    "author": "SomeUser",
    "description": "My daily driver config",
    "tags": ["thor", "gaming"]
  },
  "checksum": "sha256:<hex>",
  "settings": {
    "global": { … },
    "mirror": { "auto_start_capture": true, … },
    "touchpad": { … },
    "keyboard": { … },
    "macropad_settings": { … }
  },
  "profiles": [
    {
      "id": "…",
      "name": "My Profile",
      "layouts": [ … ],
      "macros": [ … ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For **profile-share** exports the `settings` map is always empty (`{}`), so importing
the file never touches app preferences.

Settings are stored as grouped DataStore key/value maps — no intermediate typed data classes.
Adding a new setting requires assigning the key to a section in `SECTION_MAP` or explicitly excluding it in `EXCLUDED_KEYS` (in `SettingsKeys.kt`). A unit test guard (`SettingsKeysTest`) enforces that 100% of declared preference keys are categorized, preventing silent omission during export/import.

- **MIME type:** `application/vnd.megingiard.config+json`
- **Extension:** `.mgrd`
  Macros are embedded inside each `PadProfile.macros`.
  Background images (`backgrounds/bg_<id>`) and custom button image thumbnails (`padicons/<hash>.webp`) are packaged inside a ZIP archive container alongside `config.json` when images are present. On import, all bundled icons and backgrounds are verified, unpacked, and restored to internal storage.

- **Checksum scope (v4):** SHA-256 of the minified kotlinx.serialization JSON encoding (with
  `encodeDefaults = true`) of settings and profiles only.
  Key order is determined by the declaration order of the `@Serializable` data class fields —
  no additional sorting or canonicalization is applied. Metadata changes do not invalidate the
  checksum. On import, verification first attempts raw JSON element payload evaluation to preserve
  hash fidelity for legacy/older exports created before new default fields were introduced, falling back to
  re-encoded object graph verification.

### UUID Remapping on Import

When MacroPad data is imported, `ConfigManager.importMacroPadData()`:

1. For each imported `PadProfile`, assigns a new UUID.
2. For each macro inside the profile, assigns a new UUID and builds `macroIdMap` (old → new).
3. For v2 imports: collects referenced legacy macros (from the top-level `macros` list) that
   aren't already inside the profile and adopts them with new UUIDs.
4. Remaps every `PadButton` whose action is `PadAction.Macro` via `macroIdMap`
   (falls back to original ID if not mapped).

This guarantees imported data never collides with existing data even when re-importing the same
file multiple times.

### Settings Application

Settings are exported/imported directly as DataStore key/value maps grouped by section.
On import, `SettingsManager.importGroupedSettings()` writes all values to DataStore in a
single `edit {}` call. The existing reactive pipeline (the `dataStore.data.collect {}` block
in `SettingsManager.init()`) automatically re-hydrates all `StateFlow`s, updating Compose UI
immediately.

Adding a new setting to export/import requires only one change: adding the key to the
corresponding `*_KEYS` set in `SettingsManager` (e.g. `GLOBAL_KEYS`, `MIRROR_KEYS`).

### Error Handling

- SAF read failures (permission denied, file not found) surface as `Result.failure` and are
  displayed as **in-tree overlay** dialogs.
- Checksum mismatch rejects the import with a localized error message.
- The 10 MB file size cap in `ConfigManager.readFromUri()` prevents OOM when opening arbitrary files.

### In-Tree Overlays & Sub-Pages

Configuration exports (`CreateBackupSubPage` and `ShareProfileSubPage`) and restores (`RestoreBackupSubPage`) are rendered as dedicated **sub-pages** within the two-pane scaffold, supporting gamepad-first input cards. Import review and confirmation is seamlessly handled in-deck within `RestoreBackupSubPage`, eliminating floating modal dialogs during backup restoration.

### Internal Daily Backups

To protect configuration data, Megingiard automates daily configuration backups stored locally in the DataStore:

1. **Storage Isolation**: The internal backups list (`KEY_INTERNAL_BACKUPS` preference key) is kept separate from `SECTION_MAP`. This ensures backups are isolated, are never included in custom config exports, and are not modified or cleared by external imports.
2. **First-Load Auto-Backup**: Upon app startup, the first emission of `dataStore.data` collects the fully loaded configuration. A volatile thread-safe flag `autoBackupTriggered` ensures that `triggerAutoBackupIfNeeded(context)` is invoked exactly once per process lifetime. The function checks for a backup matching today's local date string (`java.time.LocalDate.now().toString()`). If absent, it builds a full configuration snapshot using `ConfigManager.buildExport` and saves it.
3. **5-Day Retention**: Backups are kept as a serialized list of `@Serializable data class InternalBackup` entries. When a new backup is appended, the list is sorted by `timestampMs` descending and capped at 5 entries via `.take(5)`. This ensures backups representing the last 5 days the app was actually used on are preserved indefinitely.
4. **Direct Restore Selection Sub-Page & In-Deck Review**: `RestoreBackupSubPage` renders a dedicated sub-menu within Global Settings presenting the "External File" option first, followed by the daily automatic backups. Option labels are formatted using localized weekdays and exact creation times (e.g. `Sunday, 2026-05-24 21:15`). Sub-labels display a detailed profiles, layouts, and macros count. Selecting an internal backup or external file transitions the sub-page directly into the in-deck Review & Apply deck view showing archive metadata, contents overview, overwrite notice, and an Apply action card.
5. **CPU Serialization Optimization**: To prevent redundant CPU cycles during continuous settings updates (such as high-frequency coordinate saves from active MacroPad dragging actions), the preference observer caches the last-seen raw JSON string. The full JSON list is only decoded and updated into `_internalBackups` if the string content of `KEY_INTERNAL_BACKUPS` actually changes. Any serialization/decoding errors are caught and logged with diagnostic warnings (`AppLog.w`) containing detailed failure diagnostics to prevent silent failure.
