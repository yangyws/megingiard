/**
 * Runtime integrity verification for native binaries shipped in `assets/`.
 *
 * The expected SHA-256 of every binary is generated at build time by the
 * `:domain:generateNativeBinaryHashes` Gradle task and stored in
 * [NativeBinaryHashes.EXPECTED]. Each call site that is about to make a binary
 * executable, push it over ADB, or load it as a DEX MUST call [verify] first
 * and refuse to proceed on mismatch.
 *
 * This raises the cost of the "swap-binary-in-repackaged-APK" attack: an
 * attacker would have to additionally patch out this check in the Kotlin
 * code, which combined with R8 minification and APK signature pinning is
 * substantially harder than a plain file replacement.
