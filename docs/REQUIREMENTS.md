## Non-Functional Requirements

### Hardware Environment & Multi-Display Architecture

Megingiard is strictly designed for **dual-screen Android gaming handhelds** (specifically the AYN Thor). Single-screen hardware (phones, tablets, and single-screen emulators) is **permanently unsupported**. The system requires concurrent physical multi-display topology where the companion UI runs exclusively on the secondary display and configuration overlays project to the primary display. Single-screen fallbacks are intentionally excluded from the architecture.

### Battery Efficiency

The continuous loop required by the `MediaProjection` API must be implemented in a CPU-friendly manner. When leaving the mirror view, the `VirtualDisplay` must be stopped or hidden to conserve computing power and battery life. The native touch injector process must be terminated when leaving Touchpad mode.

### Security

Megingiard MUST maintain the layered security model described in [SECURITY_CONCEPT.md](../SECURITY_CONCEPT.md):

- Release builds MUST pin the expected APK signing-certificate SHA-256 via `megingiard.signing.sha256` and fail closed when the pin is missing or malformed, unless a developer explicitly opts out for local testing.
- Release builds MUST keep R8 minification and resource shrinking enabled to raise the reverse-engineering cost while preserving Android components and serialization paths through explicit keep rules.
- Native helper binaries and privileged mirror DEX assets MUST have generated SHA-256 pins and MUST be verified before they are executed, pushed over ADB, or loaded by the privileged path.
- Runtime native binary deployment MUST verify bytes before writing to app-private storage and MUST re-read and re-verify the written file before setting the executable bit.
- Privileged Mode connections MUST complete mutual HMAC-SHA256 authentication before accepting or sending feature commands over `@megingiard.privd`.
- The Privileged Mode HMAC key MUST be configurable through `local.properties`; release builds and daemon rebuilds MUST reject the public source default unless the developer supplies an explicit local non-distribution override.
- Security-relevant failures MUST be logged through `AppLog` at warning or error level so a standard diagnostic logcat captures the failure reason.

Pure SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA256 logic MUST remain covered by local JVM tests in `:domain:test`. Android runtime checks such as signature verification and full LocalSocket handshake behavior require manual device validation or future instrumentation / Robolectric coverage.

### Code Quality

State management must be centrally orchestrated via asynchronous Kotlin flows (`MutableStateFlow`) to maintain a strict separation of concerns between the UI and the Background Service. All conventions are specified in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

### Standalone Companion Autonomy (Zero Game Focus Dependency)

Megingiard Companion is a completely standalone application with zero dependencies on Game Focus. Game Focus is an optional top-screen launcher currently not released to the public. Users are not required to use Game Focus and may use stock or third-party launchers. Any bugs affecting Megingiard Companion must be addressed strictly within Megingiard Companion and shared modules, never via Game Focus.
