# Megingiard - Technical Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture and key design decisions. Per-feature technical implementation details live in each feature's **`FEATURE.md`** file:

- **[Screen Mirror](features/mirror/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — capture pipeline, `Presentation` window, pan/zoom, freeze
- **[Virtual Touchpad](features/touchpad/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — native binary, event injection, coordinate transformation
- **[Virtual Keyboard](features/keyboard/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — native binary, modifier state machine, key injection, layout system
- **[App Theming](features/theming/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — token-based `AppColors`, dark/light palettes, `LocalAppColors` CompositionLocal
- **[Security Concept](../SECURITY_CONCEPT.md)** — threat model, hardening layers, native asset integrity, and Privileged Mode authentication

## Modular Architecture

Megingiard is structured as a **Feature-First Modular Architecture** split across 9 focused Gradle modules:

### Module Responsibilities

1. **App Modules (Executables)**
   - **`:companion:ui`** — Main companion app UI layer (`com.stormpanda.megingiard`). Houses Activities, viewmodels, custom Compose views, and secondary screen presentations.
   - **`:gamefocus:ui`** — Standalone launcher application (`com.stormpanda.megingiard.gamefocus`). Houses 2:3 game poster carousel, SteamGridDB scraping triggers, and gamepad browsing views.

2. **App Domain Modules (Feature Logic)**
   - **`:companion:domain`** — Companion business logic, device managers, input injection facades (Touchpad, MacroPad, Keyboard, Mirror, Privd).
   - **`:gamefocus:domain`** — Standalone launcher domain logic and ROM launcher implementations (`RetroArchLauncher`, `GameNativeLauncher`).

3. **Shared Domain & Core Modules**
   - **`:shared:catalog`** — Installed app index, ROM file scanning, system definitions (`InstalledAppsManager`, `RomManager`, `DisplayDetector`, `RomLauncherRegistry`).
   - **`:shared:media`** — External artwork fetchers, HTTP clients, and caching layers (`SteamGridDbClient`).
   - **`:shared:session`** — Active game detection engines (`EmulatorDetectionFunnel`, `GameNativeDetector`, `RetroArchDetector`, `Pcsx2AndroidDetector`, `YuzuDetector`).
   - **`:shared:core`** — Pure JVM/Kotlin data models, serializable schemas, logging facade (`AppLog`), constants, and math helpers (`ViewportMath`).

4. **Auxiliary Standalone Modules**
   - **`:mirrorserver`** — Standalone shell-UID DEX executable loaded via `/system/bin/app_process` for un-throttled privileged display mirroring.

## Dual-Display Layout

Megingiard runs on the AYN Thor, an Android gaming handheld with two physical displays. The app lives on the **secondary (bottom) display** and provides tools that assist the user while the primary (top) display runs games or other applications.

```
Primary Display (DEFAULT_DISPLAY) — top screen, game display
  └─ [running games / other apps — captured by MediaProjection]

Secondary Display (non-default displayId) — bottom screen, Megingiard UI
  ├─ MainActivity → MainAppScreen (Jetpack Compose)
  │    └─ MacroPad-centric main content
  └─ MirrorPresentation (android.app.Presentation — ambient mirroring modes)
       ├─ TextureView / SurfaceView: hardware VirtualDisplay output (mirrors primary display)
       └─ ComposeView → BackgroundMacroPadOverlay / MirrorScreen
```

`MainActivity` and `MainAppScreen` run on the **secondary (bottom) display** (`displayId != Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY`). `MirrorPresentation` is layered on top of `MainAppScreen` on the same secondary display when ambient mirroring is active and hidden (`hide()`) when it is not needed.

The MacroPad macro editor also uses **inline full-screen overlays in the same secondary-display window** for transient recording workflows. Touch-tap recording opens a dedicated `RecordingMirrorPresentation`, while gamepad macro recording renders an in-app `GamepadRecordingOverlay` directly above `MacroTimelineEditor`. The gamepad overlay intentionally captures input from on-screen touch surfaces instead of listening to the physical controller device, so recording works without root-only device snooping while still forwarding events live through the existing virtual gamepad injector.

### Wrong-Screen Overlay

When `MainActivity` detects that it is running on the **primary display** (`displayId == Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY`) — either because the app was launched there or moved there at runtime — a global full-screen blocking overlay is shown in `MainAppScreen` on top of all content. The overlay:

- Displays a plain-language message instructing the user to move the app to the bottom screen.
- Shows an animated, vertically bouncing downward arrow (`KeyboardArrowDown`) as a directional hint.
- Consumes all pointer events, preventing interaction with any underlying controls.

Display detection is performed synchronously in `MainActivity`'s Compose tree via `LocalContext.current.display?.displayId` and stored in `AppStateManager.isOnValidScreen`. All capture auto-start paths (auto-start on resume, MacroPad ambient auto-trigger) are gated on `isOnValidScreen` to prevent a `MediaProjection` consent dialog from appearing while the app is on the primary display.

## Security Architecture

Megingiard uses layered local hardening rather than a single trust check. The concise map and threat model live in [SECURITY_CONCEPT.md](../SECURITY_CONCEPT.md); this section records how the layers fit into the runtime architecture.

### APK Identity

`MainActivity` runs `SignatureGuard.verify()` during cold start. The guard reads every signing certificate attached to the installed APK, computes SHA-256 fingerprints, and compares them to `BuildConfig.EXPECTED_SIGNING_SHA256`. Release packaging fails closed when `megingiard.signing.sha256` is absent or malformed in `local.properties`, because an unpinned release would not detect a repackaged APK.

### Native Asset Integrity

The app ships native helpers (`touchinjector_arm64`, `keyinjector_arm64`, `mouseinjector_arm64`, `gamepadinjector_arm64`, `megingiard_privd_arm64`) and `megingiard_mirror.dex` as APK assets. The `:domain:generateNativeBinaryHashes` task hashes the bytes that will ship and generates `NativeBinaryHashes.EXPECTED`. Runtime code calls `BinaryIntegrity.verify()` before any asset is executed, pushed to `/data/local/tmp`, or used by Privileged Mode.

`NativeBinaryInjector` performs a second check after writing a helper to app-private storage: it re-reads the on-disk file, verifies SHA-256 again, then sets the executable bit and marks the file non-writable. This narrows the time-of-check/time-of-use window between verified asset bytes and executed filesystem bytes.

### Privileged Mode Trust Boundary

The normal app process remains in Android's untrusted app sandbox. Privileged Mode creates a narrow shell-UID bridge by starting `megingiard_privd` through ADB Wireless Debugging. To bypass SELinux restrictions on devices with "Force SELinux" enabled, the daemon listens on a local TCP socket loopback (`127.0.0.1`, scanning ports `51234–51238`) and performs only the privileged kernel I/O requested by feature-specific ASCII commands.

Every socket connection completes mutual HMAC-SHA256 authentication before normal commands are processed. The daemon first challenges the app (`CHAL/AUTH/OK`), then the app challenges the daemon (`VERIFY/PROOF`). The 32-byte key is generated per-install during bootstrap, encrypted under Android Keystore (AES-256-GCM, hardware-backed), and provisioned to the daemon over the ADB TLS channel — it is never embedded in the APK. Detailed protocol and key-lifecycle behavior is documented in [Privileged Mode](features/privileged-mode/FEATURE.md#security-model).

### Release Obfuscation

Release builds enable R8 minification and resource shrinking. This is not the primary trust boundary, but it raises the effort required to patch out signature, binary-integrity, or socket-authentication checks. [app/proguard-rules.pro](../app/proguard-rules.pro) preserves manifest components, serialization metadata, and line-number information needed for diagnosis.
